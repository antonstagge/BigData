Get Racc'd,True,CS:GO is my favorite gambling loophole of all time. I let my 5 year old son open cases all day and he loves it. 10/10
LuK1337,False,I NOT CAN PLAY
SWAG.Brownie,False,"I've held this view of CSGO for quite some time, but have never found the time or motivation to publish my thoughts. I've been playing CS for many, many years - starting in the early 2000's through to present day. This time has seen me enjoy the game as a causual scrubber camping hostages, enjoying leveling my character in WC3 mods, smashing heads in deathmatch, surfing backwards, long-jumping, bhopping, played in quals for WCG, competed in CEVO and flew to different locations to compete competitively with my team in different tournaments. I've enjoyed CS from 1.1 to 1.6, CZ, CSS and also CSGO. No, this does not make me a better player than you, and no this does not mean I know everything, it simply means that I have spent a lot of time playing different titles of Counter-Strike, have played competitively and have experienced the good and the bad aspects of different releases. There are a handful of things that really upset me with CSGO, and they upset me more so because these issues still exist two years after I have first played the game. These issues I consider to be game-breaking bugs that make it such a waste of time to play. I enjoy CS because there is a skill curve: if you want to be the best at the game, you simply need to practice and spend more time learning the mechanics of the game than your opponent - This was certainly true in all other CS games I have played, but not CSGO. CSGO feels like it is a game of luck and chance. As the game stands, it is fun to play casually but anything competitively or MM is hampered by issues surrounding core aspects of the game. Hitboxes are not lag-compensated to follow the model of a player when jumping Hitboxes are not lag-compensated to follow the model of a player when crouching Hitboxes do not follow the animation of a player planting the bomb Aimpunch phyiscally affects recoil and is not lag-compensated If you are on > 70ms ping in a 64tick Server, this is how most events will play out: You see an enemy jump, you shoot the enemy and get no hits. You see an enemy continuing to jump peak a spot, you have to time your shoots to shoot where his head is going to be on the next cycle. You shoot thin air, blood appears and you get a headshot kill You see an enemy standing there, you shoot his chest, you get no hit and then he crouches instantly. You see an enemy standing there, you shoot his abdomen and get a headshot (because he was crouching on the server) You see an enemy, shoot first, die and get no hits. Watch the demo back and apparently how it played out was that he shot you first and your player aimpunched and the bullet actually hit the roof. You are hiding in a bombsite and see an enemy planting the bomb. You crouch and take your time and shoot his head 12 times, slowly one by one. You get no hits and die. All of these aspects of the game I consider EXTREMELY game-breaking. The fact that most people reading this will stop and think to themselves, ""Yeah, that has happened to me on a number of occasions"" just goes to show that the game is fundamentally flawed. In it's current state, the game rewards people for NOT AIMING - aka, ""good"" players in the game need only aim at the ground, run and shoot and they'll likely get a headshot, because as long as you don't aim AT the model that you see, there is a high likelihood that the server will decide you should have got a hit. The only one of these bugs that existed in Counter-Strike Source (pre-2010 OB update) was the hitboxes on the planting animation. An example of a bug that I do not consider game-breaking, but extremely frustrating, is the spectator glitch where you are not able to spec another player. For some reason, after the last update this bug was introduced and it has now been 3 weeks and there is still no patch or fix for this? A feature so important to the game such as being able to spectate your team has been inadvertently broken, and after 3 weeks there has still been no patch? That is a huge disappointment. People standing outside a smoke will be full view to others with no smoke obscuring them, but the player's screen will be completely black. This was an unintentional meta-change when trying to fix one-way smokes, and this new issue has existed for months now? The game has been changed so much due to this introduction such that people holding a site need only throw a smoke at the choke and will get an infinite advantage as anyone pushing through will have seconds delay before they are ever able to see the people that can see them. Throw a smoke down, wait until it starts to fade, teammate resmokes - rinse, repeat and run down the timer. Retaking a site with anything other than a horrid oponent who can't capitalise on the blind-criple wandering through the smoke is now completely impossible. What a horrible meta change. Why has this not been addressed this was introduced some months ago? 3D sound is non-existent in CSGO. It is not possible to tell whether someone is running above or below you, and more often than not difficult to determine whether someone is approaching from the front or behind. This game has so many core issues wrong with it that completely changes the outcome of the game that it is not funny. I find it extraordinary that so many people are able to accept this game with all these issues, and there are few posts on this reddit about these problems. I see many threads upvoted to the top of terrorists hugging each other, but hardly any threads of people discussing the pressing issues which desperately requires patching to make the game both playable and enjoyable. It'd be nice if people were able to draw the dev's attention to these issues and press for a resolution."
skapie,False,"I have always been a supporter of this game. Such depth and reward when learning  and improving at this game during my 10+ years of play. The same goes for previous renditions of this game. However, I have to give this game my first ever bad review. I believe CSGO has entered the worst state it has ever been in. This is due to the cheating in this game. The entire community is nervous. 90% of games turns into salty game of people blaming everyone of cheating. Sportsmanship is fading. Play one good game you get reported and end up in low trust factor. The developers give no CLEAR information on how this works and what to do to remedy it. Updates of this game is slow and not focused on improving the game state. Last contributing factor is the increasing amount of cheating in pro level games. As a whole it feels that my immediate contacts more or less feels the same and the ""FUN"" factor of the game is just disappearing. I am slowly starting to lose my respect for this game and might end up leaving CS for good. I sincerely hope this gets fixed soon, as I would like to see this world of CS that has given me so many hours of fun and endless gr8 memories to grow and keep growing. Sincerely yours an old timer @ CSGO"

There was zero communication between CSGO and the players, you legit just asked if we were free Wednesday, and now I wish I was busy so I never would of have to play this. EDIT: A more structured, critical review. I decided to try the game again to give a better review rather than just lashing out at what I saw earlier, and in a completely honest way, I'm still unhappy, but not as unhappy as I was prior. I still love this game if it is not evident by the number of hours that I have on my account. But still, I have some critiques on this. The Battle Royale When I heard the idea of a battle royale in CS, I was against it, they've never quite been my thing and the popularity of games like fortnite completely destroyed any hope that I had for battle royales in games. However, CSGO's battle royale does have some pros with some cons at the same time. Do take into account that I am biased against battle royales. Pros: - It's a fresh new take on the battle royale genre. - Thing like escorting hostages add a great addition to the game mode as a way to get money whilst still being involved with anything around you. - The idea of choosing and seeing where others drop is a nice feature. Cons (take into account I am biased against battle royales): - It doesn't fit well into a CS game, yes I understand that I don't have to play it but it does my head in that it's advertised on the main screen. - Ammo is actually harder to find than real life aliens, the fact that you pick ammo up 1 by 1 doesn't make this any easier. - Drones break if there is a ledge near where you are standing. I bought some ammo and the drone was confused if an inanimate wall was actually me. - The amount of actual shake you receive when getting hit is akin to an earthquake, given I had some fun with my friends going around and bashing people to the point where it's like the Negev in warmup. - Finally, it's a battle royale. You didn't have to follow this trend CS, even if it was planned a while ago. Free To Play This is one of the more concerning things that I had with the update, CS is already filled with cheaters and can sometimes make the game so irritating that I've put it down for a couple weeks. As 3kliksphilip said its probably the game with the most cheaters (Does CS:GO Updates not entertain you) But now I have some confidence in their decision for making it free to play, it allows more people to experience CS and will most likely double the population which isn't a downside. The thought that Valve has made the game free to play shows that they have confidence in VAC and that VAC will learn a lot more things due to the games new state. Prime This issue is one of the main reasons that this review is staying as not recommended. The idea that you can pay into prime and that people who have already bought the game will now have instant prime. This kind of makes me think that prime will be reduced to a standard trust factor match which cheaters are somewhat abundant. But if Valve is confident enough in their VAC, this shouldn't be a problem. However, the amount of cheaters who have probably been grinding enough to get prime on multiple accounts is worrying. Valve in General My issue with prime has nothing on this. Valve don't really know much about their audience. We believe that we are entitled due to the amount of♥♥♥♥♥♥they have given us in the past years (AUG Week, R8's introduction *solved quickly, nerfing weapon speeds *this affected pros but they can manage now, #HikoMissed). My problem isn't really with this, it's with Valve's transparency, they never tell us what they're going to do and expect us to all love their new idea like its Chef Boyardee's canned pasta. No one has really ever asked for battle royale in CS, we ask for improvements which are normally disregarded. In short, I'm upset with this update, but not as upset as I once was, I still have faith in Valve although it is withering at a fast pace. Response to comments: @PapaNotedVevo: Agreed that it makes the player base bigger, dislike the concept of battle royale in cs. @JustSqueeze: Cause why can't I? As long as I have skins and fun with my friends then who cares? @Count Chocula: H1Z1s peak player base was 150,179, it's now 24-hour peak is averaging the 3,000 range. This isn't good for a game, it puts people off from the original concept. @thehemmo: Yeah I agree with you now my man. @waffle.jpeg: I won't play it, I'm not being forced to. It's a bad addition to a competitive game and I won't play it anymore, regarding optimization, I'm glad you can run this on your 12 year old labtop as you said. And yeah I was probably wrong about the optimization thing, some of my friends with lower-end pc's still cannot run it.  @RandyCo: Prime isn't mean to be something you can pay for, prime is meant to be for people who have played the long enough and deserve a place where they can play without cheaters, cool VACnet is enabled, I forgot that gets rid of every cheater ever, did you? I just miss source man, the games only full priced because valve can't afford to make Gmod assets free. If Source-style movement was back in the game, I wouldn't care what happens."

『SAZ』,False,"Honest review of an (nearly) 15 year player Game has come a long way. SInce very first CS up to this point. Current trends actually killed this game for good. I don't think I will ever come back to it. I can't imagine going F2P on this game is a good idea purely because of cheaters and scummy players. Matchmaking is awful as is thus i see no reason to TRY to have fun playing. Battle royale? I am waiting for new Need for Speed to have that gamemode too (kappa). I don't know, I am honestly disappointed, once again by this game. Best FPS ever made has actually hit rock bottom by not being itself anymore EDIT I can see that people who have the same opinion as me are usually more experienced, whereas people that are basically new and have under 2 years of playtime would just be toxic and be part of this /perfect cancer-free/ community. Shame, but I like the discussion. Also, having a blast reading ""this game is not 15 years old"""
tknayu ^.^&,False,"Games been out for 8 years, riddled with skids and delusional cheaters... Let's make it free to play and easier for cheaters to get into prime by dropping a PRIME STATUS UPGRADE FOR 19.99 instead of continuing to ban cheater's phone numbers, and making them actually have to play the game before they ruin it for others. Also let's drop a BR mode without any sort of anti-cheat beyond VAC. Good job Valve, day you killed the game. edit- It’s 2018, we live in a day and age when your ads are tracking and monitoring you. F* off and man up and bring back the intrusive AC. Do what ESEA does but better for f* sakes. Take control of your game. Give us what we want, 128 tick MM. Stop killing off games when you run out of ideas or don’t want to exhaust funds to make them better. This is Counterstrike we are talking about.  Also fair play and up for debate... Announce when you’re about to drop the major AC overhaul. That way, the people who are stuck in MM cheating because they feel like they have no alternative, or have genuinely given up on the game, can finally go clean when they see the positive of a clean competitive game. Knowing that if they do it again in the new day and age of CS, they will be HWID banned. Then drop the hammer. You don’t need to spend all this money on some A.I. to save your PR department from the horrors of an “intrusive anti-cheat” who cares... save the f*ing game first."

ThizIzCrazy,False,"Competitive Matchmaking has been completely ruined by cheaters, Games are being HvH and legit players are caught in the middle, I gave this update a break seeing as it could've improved CS:GO as a whole but the cheating problem has gotten to the point that I don't even want to go near matchmaking. If you are looking for a better MM experience then FACEIT or ESEA are your best bet. Giving Prime to every user who bought the game was a total joke. Danger Zone isn't too bad but expect cheaters there too unfortunately and free to play users who wish to try CS are pretty much screwed too. This is the update that killed CS:GO. Edit: Spelling.

Un Lunetist Bătrân,True,Best game ever since cs 1.6.
Knight,True,"I was very young when I first got to know Counter-Strike back in  the early days of Counter-Strike 1.5. It was in an Internet-Café during Holidays where I even got to play the game for the first time.  Some years later some friends from the area were playing CS 1.6 and thats where I joined the Steam and Counterstrike-Community on January 8th, 2006.  We formed a team, trained about two years and climbed up the ladder of our local CS-League here in Switzerland. However, due to insufficient capacity (private life)  of some members and a lack of Morale we split up. I've seen Counter-Strike in all of its states from 1.5 on, 1.6, Condition Zero, Source, I even had my hands on the old mod called ""CS Promod"" where people tried to get the gameplay from 1.6 with the graphics of Source. Which was something I really liked. After a long break I decided to reroll in CS:GO and check out how the game had evolved. It took a while but the more I played and did matchmakings (good mm's ^^) the more I wanted to set foot in E-Sports again.  CS:GO is the perfect balance between the gameplay of 1.6 and the graphics of source (while its not source, definitely and luckily not.), to most efficient CS players ive talked to graphics dont matter and it explains why many Pro's do play with low resolutions and stuff like that because it reminds them of the good ol' days (from what i've read). Though it still has its harsh and sometimes frustrating learning-curve, it is worth the effort because if you truly stick to it and learn about it each time you play and try to learn from your mistakes the better you get.  Since all those years i've tried out almost all other game titles in the FPS genre, nothing could ever stand up against the simplicity and competitiveness of Counter-Strike for me.  If you're looking for a great team-experience (which you first need to create or join) in where every man counts, every round counts and has a big community involved with tournaments and stuff, this game is for you. However if you're looking for a realistic shooter that compares guns 1:1 like in real life, with bulletdrop and things like that, this game is definitely not for you. I hope my shared thoughts on the game where helpful and gave you a bit of insight whether you want to join our community.  Best Regards Knight"

RedK,True,"2.7 million reviews as of writing this. lol Been playing Counter-Strike since 1.5 that came out in 2002. For some of us it has a lot of memories and childhood nostalgia. To keep it short yes, I would recommend to see what all the fuss is about if you haven't already. To try and write something useful here is my advice to you, new player, if you want to improve: * It's alright you suck, CS:GO is a highly highly skill based game, don't sweat it. If you're not having fun sucking, though, you should probably quit. There will be a lot of sucking and it's OK to rage sometimes, but if it's constant no fun just move on * Get a good mouse specifically for first-person shooters. No, that Razer Naga you play World of Warcraft with won't do. Google 'Rocket Jump Ninja mice' for good recommendations from a 19+ years Quake player * Alongside the mouse, REALLY I mean REALLY spend the time to find your mouse sensitivity. It is worth it. There are plenty of guides to google * have a MINIMUM of 60 FPS, otherwise you're really gimping yourself. Personally I wouldn't play without at least a steady 100 * No, you don't need a 144Hz monitor, I reached Global (highest official rank) perfectly fine without it. It is nice though if you can afford it * As with anything, consistency and practice is key. The other rarely mentioned but just as important thing, though, is TAKE BREAKS. If you feel burnt out just play something else. It's fine. You will come back fresh and ready to improve * If you won, but didn't improve - you lost. If you lost, but you improved - you won. Have this mindset and your results will take care of themselves * SoloQ is really as any other game, if you have a hard time handling negativity this also might not be for you. I personally just mute any sort of toxicity and that works for me * Get a PRIME account (reach lvl 21) ASAP and only play with it enabled when possible. The increase in game quality is noticable Good luck!"

Cobalt. loot.farm,True,"The competitive Counter-Strike scene is at its peak. There’s more talent than ever in pro CS, which means that in order to pick the best players in the world you need clear, specific criteria. To make this ranking, a player must have competed in a number of top tier events—no player can be awarded top ten status for simply being incredible online. Almost by default, that means the player will be on a top team as well, which is the case for everyone on this list. I also decided to use roughly the past six months’ results for statistical comparison, with obviously more emphasis on recent performances, as they are most likely more indicative of these players’ current form."

Mr. Unforgiven,True,"So I have played this game for a couple years now with a break of 8 months between it because of some updates who got me from MGE back to the silvers.. So now I am back at it again and I am kinda in love again. Yes I also think they should change the VAC and Cooldown system, because it is pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥atm. But if you just play the game like you should play it, it is a pretty good game. Before my pause I spend a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of money on skins, i had a♥♥♥♥♥♥load, I sold them all and at this point I only use the skins I get dropt in game or didnt sold.  So the latest update ( adding wingman and scoutgame) I think thats pretty good. Only thing is they should change the wingman stuff. Because I played a couple times against people who are Global on competive so that is nog fair yet. Also the cooldown system should be sepperate.  but the game is good."

Since they made the game free getting banned doesnt matter any more.  They just start up a new steam account and jump back in.   I mentioned earlier that finding someone who is actually botting would be a rare-ish occurance but tonight I attempted to get some new friends into the game and in the first 3 lobbys (1 casual dustii, 2 arms race) there where botters just one taping everyone from lundicris angles and distances. I know botting is gonna happen but like dang, calm down.  Are you so frustrated that the only thing you can do to release that is to boot up a program and no-skill your way through matches? So after my friends got killed over and over again but some resentful basement dewller, I suggested we play a round of competitve.  ""surely there wont be as many hackers there right?""  Nope.  Had some guy boosting his friends with an aim bot.  The guy had like a 90% headshot ratio by half time and could hit just about everyone no matter what was going on.  His account was permently banned by the end of the match but does it matter?  His friends accounts (that were being destroyed by my new-to-game friends) got a comp win due to a series of aimbot aces.  The guy who was aimboting has probably already created a new account and is back in comp right now boosting his (proabally) silver 4 friends and now I have 4 friends who dont want to play this game simply because of this experience. This may seem like a rant, cause it kinda is, but I'm just tired of it.  No one wants to play a game with no chance to win.  The games community will die down evenutally to where there are only devout cs fans, botters and the passing interested gamer.  Making this game free to play was a big mistake that I dont believe can be ratified.   If you have a counterpoint or dissagree with what I said then let me know."

Also they said that for preventing gambling but that will never fix gambling problem because these sites will do balance system so you will play with balance.

The BR mode is great fun. I appreciate that they did it, and like it a lot more than pubg. I'd been waiting for it for a long time.

christoff . cs.money,True,"I've been playing Counter-Strike since around 2000 when it was 1.6 beta.  It was a natural progression for me from HL Deathmatch which was a ton of fun back in the day also.  I've been loyal to this game for almost 20 years and have racked up hours I wouldn't even want to know playing it, but i've had a ton of fun with it too!!  It's funny to watch and participate in something as it evolves and grows, especially to something that has become so popular on a global scale and not only that, without CS I question if there would even be a Steam service.  It's funny how things happen!!   Nobody will ever read this so i have no idea why i'm spending the time writing a review of this type, especially when i started out just to gain a credit for more XP, funny :)   CS and the community have got me through a few difficult times in my life and i'm forever grateful for that, but I have to say that the current state of affairs with the game, steam and Valve are a little sad.  There's no interraction with the fanbase of the game that made Valve and Steam what it is today, and that's very disappointing for me.  Valve own such a fantastic product but appear to have lost sight of their roots and where all their success came from.  The development of the game has lagged behind and if not careful will quickly become the way of the Blackberry (I was going to say DoDo but thought BBerry was just the same and applicable!).  Why has there not been greater advancement of the Source platform to take better advantage of today's gaming PC horsepower and reinvigourate a community that's becoming quickly displeased with the lack of communication as to the games direction, as well as current play-ability, variety and lack of transparancy?  If Valve have no intentions of investing the required resources and money into developing this sleeping giant of games into something that will see an explosion of interest, praise and thanks from the gaming community as a whole then...why not sell it to someone who will take it forward with purpose fans like me are crying out for???  Think about it and get back to me why don't you (and i'll be offered a job by valve to lead the team forward into delivering a product the community really wants - sarcasm). My review won't be complete without touching on the current Steam vs Opskins, and the whole trading saga in general. Why won't Valve introduce an age bracket market for trading etc. that requires Government official Photo ID Age verification that removes certain restrictions like trading for and returning real money etc.?  There's so much potential there, the market history proves that, so why not consider offering more than one type of service?  It's a little shortsighted from ValSteam to not consider their market demographics are as varied as the number of games on sale in their store and have never really persued any course of action to capitalize on those different market segments, or maybe you are, or, maybe you're just dealing with so much legal backlog from the ""loot box"" gambling situation?!?!?!  Who know's?  Certainly nobody in the community, why?  No communication.  Is it because you don't think you're client base are capable of comprehending the current situation or is it because the majority of your client base are 15 and under and you don't consider that a worthwhile demographic to answer to?  A closing comment on this particular aspect of the review...Valve/Steam...please remember that every year that client base grows, so does the diversity of age and the growing expectations from a community you yourselves helped build, so be prepared and be willing to change or you too, will go the same way as the Blackberry DoDo.  Anyway, CS is a great game and I'll always play it and just like every place in this world, both real and virtual, you will find the majority of people are good and don't cheat, but you also get the least desireable of people you find everywhere too and thankfully, like everywhere else, they're the minority. Cheers Chris P.S. UPDATE - My hours are incorrect. My pc is never off for other reasons and CS is running in the background idling just like my AV.  Save your time if you were going to post a comment about my hours, pleeaaasee"

AyDrin,False,"4/10 Great game, with amazing potential. But lack of developer trancparency and rampant cheating will lead to it's downfall. Lets start this off by saying V.A.C. is a joke... it doesn't do much other than be a meme for the community to bash on. Valve makes billions of micro transaction and yet does nothing to improve player experience by cracking down on cheater and hackers. Every low skill competetive game is full of smurfs (players with alot of experience playing in lower level games) and or hackers. Valves overwatch program catches non cheating players who happen to have a streak of good games/plays, and fails to capture the ""closet hackers"" - or people who using hacks, but play a style that makes it seem that don't.  ""Prime Matchmaking"" failed to deliver on it's goal of seperating out cheatings/smurfs from players who wan't to play against players their skill level and have a good time. It was a good idea, worked at first, but if a player can get a program undetectable by VAC, how hard is it for them to buy Prime Ready Accounts, and get access to a phone number? Rumors have been spreading on community forums that Valve is in the works of a ""Super VAC"" yet it's been 5 or so years since the games launch, and they yet to deliver on anything more than in game accessories (gun skins, stickers, music kits, GLOVES, pins, etc) and questionable mechanic changes. I understand they want to make money - but who is going to buy their products when no one is around because of the shakey servers and toxic/hacking community. I'm extremely disappointed in Valve - like many others, this review will get drowned in the vastness of QQ and phony reviews. There is only one way to getting Valve to act... Boycott all Valve microtransactions. I'm am no longer buying any more products through Counter Strike or any other valve game until they make reforms to match making. When they have they revenue stream in jeopardy - only then will they listen to player/community concerns and start making changes we want/need to see. For current players, I feel your struggle, hear your cries, and share your rage. Stop purchacing valve skins, keys, kits, pins, whatever. Stop using the community market and boycott all valve micro transactions. For future players - hold off from playing this game, the current experience will only turn you away and make your want to quit before you have seen the small glimor of light that is the csgo community. As well, don't purchase the game unless you are ready to pay 5$ a month for a 3rd party subscrition in order to have a decent competetive experience. TL:DR - Game has potential, but too many hackers. Valve doesnt do ENOUGH to remedy the issues. Use your wallet as your voice, stop buying Valve related products (including your favorite skins) until our concerns and issues are addressed and fixed."
Hellephant,False,"I can both say yes and no to recommend this game. Counter-Strike, can be good with friends but if you try to play a lot of random games to climb the ranks you will encounter the second most toxic gaming community ever. You get every kind of stereotype on here from the kid who slept with your mother to some guy calling everyone a b*tch N*gga.  With well over 2000 hours I can not recommend CS:GO in its current condition. Why is that? -Servers. The servers are horrible. 64 tick is not enough to play on. You will often encounter bullets that do no damage yet there is blood on the walls behind them. Their performance is lack luster and lots of servers are doing a stutter/stop as of lately or the registration is just... Non-existant. -Hackers. They are still running rampant in CSGO. ""Prime"" accounts are still subject to them. It seems as if VAC is not working at all. You will encounter a LOT of them from Silver to MGE. (There are smurfs but you can tell them apart from hackers very easily. I enjoy playing smurfs as I see it as a chance to see what I need to work on to get better.) -Toxic community. This game relies on three very major things. 1. Aim 2. Communication 3. Listening. There are very seldom times that you will come across a team that is willing to Communicate and Listen. From my experience (MGE or lower for the majority) A lot of people do not communicate because they are talking too much and when you ask them to hush for the rest of the game and to type, they throw hissy fits as if their mother just denied them a cookie. If you try to communicate with people and call stuff, and they blame you for their death becuase you're trying to communicate where the enemies are. ""One B"" - Teammate dies - ""OMG WHY DID YOU SAY HE WAS BE WHEN CLEARLY THEY ARE A!""  Everyone ALWAYS tries to blame others instead of understanding that it was just good timing on their end.  -Gambling addictions with opening cases. Opening cases can be fun at times. However, the absolutely horrible prices for keys makes it a very expensive risk if you get a simple item that is only worth $0.02 on the CM. A lot of people waste their money here.  NOW FOR THE GOOD -Meeting awesome new people. I have met quite a few people on here. Some of the best people I have ever had the chance to encounter. It was awesome! We still enjoy kicking back and having a few beers.  -Gaming Tournaments. TONS of LAN parties play CSGO or CS1.6 and it's an absolute amazing time. Everyone gets super serious but also come out of it with smiles, win or lose.  -Hand + Eye coordination improvement. My hand and eye coordination used to be utterly horrible. However, MAAAAAAAANY years ago, when I first got CS1.5 my hand and eye coordination improved drastically over the time.  Would I recommend this game? Yes and no Yes - Having fun with friends is great! No - Everything stated that was bad. And it grows the more and more you play."
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA,False,"It's legit one of the worst games of all time. (I rate it 1/10, even that's too high) Let me explain why: - The anti-cheat system There is no need to explain how bad it is. It's so bad, that people are getting banned instantly for using skinchanger, but a friend of mine got OVERWATCH banned (not even vac) 7 (!) months after he started cheating. Good job valve. Oh btw, it was a public hack, he didn't even pay a single cent for it. - The community It's cancer overall. Seriously, so many people in the community are either toxic, can't speak English, or are just trolling around and thinking that's fun. I lost so many ranks and matches just because some c*nts don't speak any language or don't even speak at all (yes, there are people who don't even talk to you). If you kill someone in a cheeky way, you are called a cheater instantly.  - The matchmaking system Let me explain it: You are playing with 4 other people (which can be your mates aswell if you queue with them) against 5 opponents. Basically, it's meant to be competitive. But in some cases the matches are so one-sided, that it makes you rage so hard that your neighbours call the police at 2 a.m. Ranking up takes up to 17 wins in a row (I had to win 17 games in a row to rank up to global), but you can rank down 3 ranks after a lose (happened to a mate of mine). It's absolute bullsh*t, and don't even bother trying to play. - The servers 64 tick, extreme lags, hitreg and server delay are enough cancer. But there are some bugs which are so weird and wtf that it's ?? For example, there used to be a glitch that if you spammed a buy bind, that you spawned as a spectator. IN MATCHMAKING FFS. If there are such glitches and volvo still doesn't care and add sh*tty gloves, you know that it's over. - Valve itself As mentioned earlier, they don't give a sh*t about anything the community says. They used to care about the community back then in 2013, when skins weren't even added yet. In 2014, they added the CZ-75. It was legit better than rifles. For 300 dollars... A pistol...  It took them 8 months to nerf it, until it was nerfed to hard that it was rekt completely. In 2015, they added the revolvo. It was a pocket awp. It had the same stats as the awp, before it was nerfed 2 days later. After this, it was clear that valve doesn't give a sh*t about anyone. They kept adding stuff like graffitis, gloves, new skins... In 2017, they still don't care about anything. They ""UPDATED"" the negev. Great update. In conclusion, please don't play it. It's not worth your time."

TURBOSKILL,True,"It doesn't matter how good you are any more, you will be judged solely on the market value of your inventory. You should have one of your several Karambit knives equipped at all times and inspect it in game whenever possible to ensure that anybody who is spectating you is aware that you are aware you're being watched and you are absolutely showing off that extremely pricey knife you own. Your stats are irrelevant now, most people aren't even aware that the 'Tab' key actually has a function in game. It doesn't matter if you don't know what 'eco' means. Fu­ck team work. You have a 'BOOM' AWP in your inventory, as long as you have $4750 cash in game you're buying an AWP. You will mock anyone who decided to give their Nova the 'Walnut' skin. Same goes for people who give their FAMAS the 'Doomkitty' skin. You will only equip 'StatTrak' weapons and the first thing you do when you acquire one is go on an idle server and get several hundred kills on AFK players in order to pad the stats so you don't look like a total n00b. Whenever a new case is released you will buy as many cases and keys as it takes in order to acquire 'an Exceedingly Rare Special Item!' Disregard the fact that you will end up spending three times as much as you otherwise would've by buying this directly from the market, it's only your parents' money after all. Besides, your birthday is next month and Christmas/Easter/[insert public holiday here] is just around the corner so you won't have to wait too long before you can blow more of their money on digital goods. You will also plaster ever single skin you own with multiple unseemly stickers with the intention of creating a unique skin for your weapon. Your 'Easy Peasy' and 'Ninjas in Pyjamas' stickers totally don't look ridiculous whatsoever. You will also name tag all of your weapons in order to add that final personal touch to the weapon you invested so much time and money in. You don't own an AK or an M4 any more, you only own weapons with names like 'xXx OG Snoop Dogg' and 'dubstep warrior'. You now have all the knowledge required to start playing CS:GO. Go forth and procure many skins of great value."

I can't rate it 3/10 because valve doesn't like anything that has to do with 3, and will take down this review I can't rate it 2/10 because only 2 team mates know call outs, but half of the time in a different language.

In every game there is a 90% chance that you will either get a cheater or a smurf, and what does Valve and CS GO community do about it?? they release new cases.  Before this game used to be fun, and after a hard day, I would come and enjoy a few rounds with my friends, but now instead of fun I get stressed with all the cheaters. It is really sad to watch a downfall of such a gaming giant as CS, but this is was greed does to the best of us.   I DO NOT RECOMMEND TO PLAY THIS GAME"

バブ,False,"Played 950+ hours. Played after a very long break from May, and grinded up to LEM-Supreme level until August. Now, I've had enough. The game is not developing, only getting worse and worse. Weekly ""updates"" which are making the game even less competitive, screwed-up hitboxes (even on 128 tick servers), and a♥♥♥♥♥♥tons of cheaters. Valve does not do anything about it, they only care about money (which is why they are making new cases), they don't give a crap about the players. Cheaters everywhere, ♥♥♥♥ed up hitboxes.  Really liked this game, even had a semi-pro team (which was improving FASTER then CSGO itself). I'd like to say that cheaters only play in competitive games, but I would be lying. I was playing with my friend who just started a game, and does not have rank, so we could play casual games only. The enemy team thought I was cheating (even though I have 20+ screenshots on my profile with my rank), so one turned his/her hacks on, and... you know the rest.

Mr. Robot,False,How to kill game in one day? - Make it free without upgrading servers and don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about all the people who bought it.
MΛΛNLΛMP,False,"I have played this game for years and years. Ever since I first layed my hands on it I loved it, and have never stopped loving it... untill today. The biggest problem in CS:GO history was its hackers, and by making it free to play (and upgrading every person to prime status?!) they're opening the floodgates to a sh!tshow of hackers. Who asked for battle royale mode? I didn't. Why did I get a stupid ♥♥♥♥ing badge to show people I'm one of the idiots who purchased the game a long time ago? Why not spend time fixing issues and making the game better instead of this sh!t? The first and final experience I had in ""Danger Zone"" was that some noob killed me because he had more luck finding weapons than I did. Not his skill (he missed, I hit headshots), not my lack of skill, but luck decided the outcome of our shootout. This is not what CS:GO was ever about and I despise valve's decision to make it so. Don't download this, unless you like games like fortnite, in which case: why aren't you just playing fortnite? The last decent compitetive true fps has fallen. ps. I want a refund. I didn't pay 20 euro for CS:GO to become this horrid adaptation of the characterless battle-royale that's free-to-play and consequently free-to-hack."
KQLY Back ** twitch.tv/kqly,False,"HACKERS EVERY GAME, VALVE DOESNT CARE AT ALL, GAME IS IN A TERRIBLE STATE, almost everyone has cheats installed and they start cheating when they lose!"
:Re,False,"CS:GO, I mean the game itself is very fun but there is a huge issue that makes the experience so terrible. Once you reach a decently high rank in matchmaking that is Legendary Eagle Master and above, 60% of the games you will proceed to play will be against cheaters. These cheaters use paid cheats of atleast ($40USD) per month; and they bypass overwatch by closet cheating, which means they hide their cheats by trying to look legit. This allows them to bypass overwatch as they hide their cheats quite well and make their shots look as if it was all luck. I myself have been queued against cheaters 8 games in a row in LEM-GE matchmaking. Because of stuff like this I've started moving onto other games such as Overwatch (the game from Blizzard). I actually enjoy CS:GO more than Overwatch but the game is filled with cheaters in the higher matchmaking ranks that ruins the experience for people like myself. The situation is actually disgusting, where we now have people who que with cheaters in order to gain a high rank, because at this point if you want to reach and maintain GE you either que with cheaters or become one; atleast in the Oceania scene of matchmaking. And I forgot to mention that this is in Prime matchmaking, which is supposed to be fairly safe. These cheaters even have groups where they brag about how they cheat and nothing happens to them, even inviting more people to join them and play matchmaking while they either boost them or cheat together. CS:GO as a game is great, but I really hope Valve puts a hold on adding new skins all the time and actually makes a decent anti-cheat which bans all those external software users. Many people suggest ESEA, but there are people like me who have no interest of going pro or playing at tournaments in the future, ESEA is for people who are serious and dedicated to the game; for those who are looking to be a step ahead. I'm just a normal player who enjoys the game, I'm not looking to go big in CS, so I do not see why someone like myself would need to pay to play a legit game of ranked CS:GO. What's funny is a third party matchmaking client has a better anti-cheat than a multi-millionaire company like Valve. The VAC waves of one cheat are not enough. There are many other cheats out there and new ones are made all the time. I really like this game but at this point I feel like quitting due to stuff like this. This is why for now I won't recommend this game; not unless Valve atleast manages to actually fix this issue."

⌚ Wristwatch,True,"I slowly look at the luminescent green dial of my wristwatch, which tells me it is 5:46, am. Damn. Another night of Insomnia.   I sit up in my bed, and listen to the soft hum of my Radeon™ HD 7870 GHz Edition, as her fans slowly cool the surface of her brilliant silicon plates. The only light in this room comes from the electric blue glow of my keyboard, and the azure LEDs in my Razer Abyssus. I press a button, and the display of a 23 inch, 1080p IPS monitor lights up, colors shifting and changing in psychedelic pattens, chromatic waves of light bluring and stabilizing to send an image within my mind.  My desktop stares back at me; the only icon the Recycle bin. I move my eyes to the Taskbar, where the icons for Windows Explorer, Star Citizen, Mozilla Firefox, and lastly Steam return my gaze. I click on Steam, and watch as a loading bar appears. The light from the moniter shines brilliantly on my face, and if I look closely into it, I can see myself reflected in the crystal surface, eyes staring deep into a mad realm of pixels and insomnia. Steam finally loads. Oh, what's this? There's a sale on? Ah, too bad; I only have one cent in my wallet. I click the library tab in a futile attempt to find meaning. My list of games appears, showing me hints of open doors into new worlds, strange and wonderful. What path sould I choose? Should I join battle with Dragons, in the strage land of the Nords? Or, perhaps, I should launch the StarCitizen hangar module, and lust after a dream of flight, a game not yet finished. Ah, but here it is; Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. How many hours have I thus spent within you, oh CS:GO? You have been the reason for many nights without sleep, many days of ragequits, many days of fun and sadness. I pull out a calculator from somewhere on my desk: dividing one thousand, eight hundred and eighty-five hours by twenty-four tells me that I've been within this game for seventy-eight point five days so far. Damn. The game begins loading, and I hear the soft hum of GPU fans, and the silent sound of the sunrise, far beyond the single window of my room. _ Ah, where was I? I guess I feel alseep for a second there. Skip the intros, enter main menu, searc- Wait, what? 20 friends online? But, it's like 6 am... Oh, right, timezones. Eh, I might as well invite all these people. Well, I guess I didn't want to play with them anyway. Green light fills my room, I press accept, and wait for the ninth player. Who, it seems, never can figure out what the big glowing green button actually means. Oh well, it just found another match anyway. Well, third time's the chram, right? I guess not. Fourth time does it, and we're away. Cue loading screen, begin meaningless text I've seen only a few thousand times before. I get up, walk towards the kitchen, and only trip twice on miscellaneous paraphernalia in the dark hallways. The bleak windows of the room greet me: pale dawn, gray clouds and black trees visible through their panes. The neon numerals of the microwave tell the time as 6:07. I search the pantry and refr!gerator, but find nothing of value. I lower my standards and try again, this time coming up with a few tastless cookies of some kind. I begin a pilgrimage to whence I came. The last stars of night grow cold and die; as color once again spreads over the sky. Monitor glow, winter snow, cybernetic flow. My quest now complete, with prize in hand, I return to my chair. 0's and 1's stream across a fiberoptic gulf of space, connecting people hundreds of miles apart in a beautiful lattice of data, all for my enjoyment. I begin the first round, and purchase a FN Five-Seven and a Flashbang grenade. I move over to long A, and hold my sights on the old wooden doors. An insurgent sprints through the open door, firing his Glock-18 as fast as he can, his bullets hitting the wal beside my head. I pull the trigger, a volcanic plume of hot gas propelling a one gram lead alloy projectile at twice the speed of sound into the side of his head; The FN 5.7×28mm armor piercing round delivering a fatal 540 Joules of energy. The neon Stattrak™ display mounted on the left side of my Case Hardened Five-Seven increases by one, and a bright flare from the muzzle reflects its light in the cold metal of a name tag, the words ""NOT ON MY WATCH"" silently mocking those fools who fall by my pistol, in an absurd pun about clocks. Another Terrorist moves into view, I fire three supersonic rounds into his chest, and one in his skull. Again the neon numbers shift and rearrange in a mad dance, as bullets enter my manly chest hair and are absorbed. A third Terrorist fires, and I die in the gameworld, madly shooting as my bullets hit empty space. Pixels shift and change in an algorithmic song, and my teammates finish what I began, with the severing of a red wire a small number one is added in blue to the top of my screen. Second round, man. Time to roll. I got long-  wait, why are two of you going there? Nevermind, I'll hold Catwalk. _ Turns out they decided to rush Mid with pistols. Poor choice.  I leap out of catwalk into mid as they rush the doors, electric blue pathways of fire traversing the void between my tazer and and the insurgent's back. He screams in death as I drop the now-useless tazer and unholster a Bizon SMG;  9mm rounds begining to sputter at 320 meters per second into the backs of my foes as a Terrorist pulls a 180 and flicks a round into my skull with his CZ-75 Automatic, punching through my helmet into the flesh beneath. I mutter to myself ""I ♥♥♥♥ing hate that gun"" while typing out ""#TAZED ♥♥♥♥♥"" in all chat. Childish insults fly like eagles, soaring over skies of wire and valleys of silicon to majestically land in the lower right of my vision, proclaiming their wondrous messages for all to see. ""get rekt"" ""u suck"" ""TIME to die, amirite"" Using the mighty power of a pistol save round, the enemy gains a round. From far beyond my drywall cube, a sun the color of a Helium discharge tube bleeds the first light of Autumn into a sky the color of Krypton: but here I am safe from its incandescent fingers, here, the persistance of color exists in the 60hz of my monitor. Perhaps tomorrow will be different? Oh, but I don't think it will. The scoreboard moves with its own hateful volition, seemingly granting rounds with a heart of cinder and magma. Chaos lies within its eyes. Final round of the first half begins and I press f1 to auto buy, supplanting my XM1014 from the previous round with an M4A4 Bullet Rain, tastefully decorated with a ""REKT"" holographic sticker and renamed ""Clockwork Ass♥♥♥♥ing"". I once again reflect on what a stupid name that is, and regret selling my Desert Eagle Blaze to buy it. Surprisingly, my team manages to hold a push at long. In the simultaneous push to cat a rain of lead from a thundering sky finds my face with magnetic precision, and in the downtime I skim through my Ebook library on my phone. I've been considering writing something in the style of Neuromancer or Ready Player One for awhile now, perhaps if I can find the right subject... Oh well, that's a project for another day. Translation: never. Halftime, and the tally stands at ten for them and five for us. I've seen worse. I've seen better too, but what the hell, this isn't hopeless yet. Pistol round begins and I buy Dualies, partly just to ♥♥♥♥ with people and partly because for reasons that I can neither explain nor defend I'm ridiculously good with them. Don't dis my Dualie skills, man. Just accept it. Like a wizard and his wand: you do not choose the Dualies, the Dualies choose you. I pop smoke Mid and rush Catwalk, suddenly realizing I hit the character limit while subsequently breaking the 4th wall. I slowly look at the luminescent green dial of my wristwatch, which tells me it is 6:34, am. Damn. Another night of Insomnia."

DUNCAN DONUTS,True,"In this game you are a Terrorist or elite Counter-Terrorist who has never fired a gun in their life before a round starts. You must help your character learn how to control their guns while killing enemies. Strangely, each character has the mysterious power to fire one or two shots without ridiculous recoil by very briefly jerking in the opposite direction they are moving in.  When your character wears a Kevlar vest, every part of your character, except the head, are made out of steel. Therefore, the only way to quickly kill people is to shoot them in the head. This can be annoying at first, but you will soon get used to shooting a small smudge of pixels on top of a character's body.  The Goddess of Guns can materialize guns in your character's hands a few seconds before a round starts. However, your character must pay for the guns, which have vastly overinflated prices. When you have the right amount of money, the Goddess will flash a menu in your character's eyes, allowing them to select the guns they want. More advanced users can make guns materialize out of thin air with their mind as long as they have the right amount of money. Maps are often about evil terrorists trying to bomb deserted places. Vandalism is a very serious crime in the Counter-Strike series, so elite Counter-Terrorists are deployed to stop them. Unfortunately for the Terrorists, they are dumb and only packed one bomb. However, the Counter-Terrorists do not know how to pick up a dropped bomb, so the Terrorists can still pick it up after it is dropped by a fallen friend. In some maps, the terrorists have kidnapped a janitor and low-level desk jockey in a building. The Counter-Terrorists have been deployed to save one, not both, of the hostages. In reality, this is just a thinly-veiled excuse for the CTs to murder the Terrorists while pumping rounds into the invincible hostages. One weird thing about hostage maps is that you can purchase a ""Hostage Rescue Kit"", which somehow makes gives you the ability to put a grown man on your shoulders in a second. Perhaps it is a spell scroll that allows hostages to hover to your character's shoulders.  Overall, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a surprisingly solid game about people with the worst gun handling abilities ever seen on Earth. Even though your characters have the aiming abilities of someone with Parkinsons Disease, you have many tactical options that make the game very fun and dynamic. It's worth picking up."

We need much harsher punishments for players queuing with cheaters. They should be temporarily banned from prime for 4 weeks along with the cheaters' ban.

Holo,False,"I love playing CS:GO, but the game becomes literally unplayable whenever it goes on sale. After a sale hackers and smurfs grab a new copy of the game and go right back into making life miserable for everyone else.  Matchmaking is useless, smurfs purposfully throw games to make sure they derank or stay at their current rank. Apparently it is unable to detect when a person destroys people at a much higher rank then him, and then throws the next game or two. No pattern at all here, but hey, let's see if we can get them to buy some skins. VAC needs major work. It's literally useless, and I feel like they've just stopped development for it.  At this point it really looks like CS:GO is a dying game. It's in maintenance mode and nothing major that will really help the game and fix any of it's issues will ever be done. Sure, we'll get an updated map, maybe new skins, or new goods for crates, but we'll never get the drastic fixes that are really needed.  Right now it needs the following major changes: 1. Ban smurf accounts - Overwatch has taken this approach and has made MM much more enjoyable and the games seem much more evenly matched than CS. I just don't enjoy playing OW as a competitive game. It's not fun when one of your teammates needs to lose the match so he can keep his rank low. 2. Major overhall to VAC - repeated small updates to counter what is currently being made by hackers doesn't really cut it. You need to get ahead of the game and make it difficult enough to reverse engineer that it deters people from even trying. 3. Take community feedback more seriously - small updates that have been requested haven't happened. Some people have requested a non ranked 5v5 mode for warmups and practice. This would probably take very little work and it still hasn't happened. Some bugs have been found by YouTubers that don't make it into the next update, but guess what NEW CRATES! 4. STOP PUTTING THE GAME ON SALE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.  5. Start temp banning toxic players. Cool, you're spinbotting/smurfing... do you really need to talk♥♥♥♥♥♥too? 6. Overhaul match making to try and detect when people are smurfing and purposfully throwing games and start promoting these people to their proper rank. Hey, maybe add an option to report players as smurfs or ""too good"". Or even see how many CS:GO accounts are owned at one location and try to take this into account when determining if it's a smurf or not (hey, it's possible sibblings have seperate accounts), I hope some of these things happen because it would make CS:GO a much better game, but I doubt it'll happen. I've been playing CS accross 3 accounts for over 800 hours and I've witnessed Valve's apathetic nature to CS:GO. Gaben loves DOTA and wants to make sure it's successful as an eSport, but at the same time CS:GO's game team has shrunk in size and been left to decline into mediocrity."

You would say that im 'low skill silver, l2p and etc', but for 2k hours of playing from different accs i've seen a lot of things."
DreameR,False,"This review is carefully worded explanation on my 'departure' from CS:GO and why in its current state, I would not recommend the game. This is somewhat lengthy, so it is really down to you whether or not you actually decide to read it all.  So, where do I begin? Well, after reaching the second highest matchmaking rank (Supreme Master First Class) in October 2015 and continuing to play CS:GO from there on throughout 2016, I can say I've had a lot of experience with the game. In that time, I've clocked 1.3k hours and have seen a lot of changes. It's funny really, when I consider the very beginning. For my very first MM rank, I successfully achieved Silver 1. That day I was so excited, only to find out it was the lowest rank there is. Yeah, that sort of sucked. That's not something that deterred me though, because back then, I found enjoyment out of the game and saw a lot of potential that made me want to fight to the top.  So, what exactly happened which took that enjoyment away? During 2016, I continued to play competitive CS, that being through regular MM, Faceit or even some ESEA. The difference from 2015-2016, is that in 2016, I began to often take breaks. These 'breaks' often came as a result of several angry occasions where I was confronted by the issues surrounding CS. Those issues are mostly the obvious ones everyone knows about, such as the increasing amount of cheaters, lack of necessary updates, hit registration, community etc. The issues are something I wish to look more deeply into. Alongside hit registration, there is the problem of accuracy as a whole. The fact that you can have an AWP positioned on a players head and somehow 'miss' the shot, yet a player can running headshot you with a pistol is just insane. Further speaking about cheaters, there is the fact nothing is done to truly stop them. The developers of the game are greedy and they know how cheaters can be of benefit to them. When the time comes for a cheater to finally get banned, they can just go pay to get the game once more on another account. Within an hour or so of being banned, they are straight back. That's not the only instance of them being greedy. Take the graffiti update as an example. Instead of focusing on the game breaking issues, they add paints. Now, this brought a lot a nostalgia. Of course though, the first paint you recieve is awful and you have to go purchase more in order to have something that looks good. The limited use feature that prevents you having a graffiti spray for more than 50 uses just further proves of how hungry they are for money. A last point I wish to mention, is that I cannot forget about the unbelievably toxic community. I do respect this one is difficult to control though.  Even despite all these game problems, I always managed to return to CS:GO. The reasons for this, as follows, were boredom, the fact that I was not too bad of a player or after I watched a Pro/YouTuber perform really well. These factors gave me the naive idea that I could once again gain enjoyment out of the game. That idea was soon shattered every time, when I was reminded of the state of the game and how it hasn't improved on any of the given issues. Huge attention comes to the game through the eSports scene or the regular community, however nothing changes.  In order to put an end to the cycle I got myself in of leaving and returning, I promised to quit CS:GO for good in order to enjoy other games and activities outside gaming. I certainly had a fun time in playing CS:GO, however the increasing issues, lack of attention towards issues and the fact the communities voice is not heard, has currently killed the game for me. Who knows where things will go in the future with this game? I hope things may look up.  Side note - I find it very amusing that so many of the positive reviews are full of content that is negative about the game.  TL;DR - Quit CS:GO because of cheaters, greedy developers, toxic community, accuracy issues, lack of motivation etc.   In an attempt to avoid any comments calling me 'hypocritical', although I will still most likely receive them, I am adding this update. Just now, I have reinstalled CS, this now being a month down the line since having it uninstalled. Whilst I have got the game back again, this review is still relevant as my views about the game have not really changed. The simple reason for me getting this game once more, is the fact I have been requested by many to play. Through requests, I have made the choice to maybe play with some friends here and there if they need the extra player. Chances are my enjoyment on the game will still be low and I do not intend to play this game regularly."

n8,True,Valve's Depression Quest is a masterfully crafted simulation of what it feels like to be a depressed russian. 11/10.
Troy,True,"Want a real and honest review? Here you go: Used to be one of the best FPS games out there. At this point the game is so broken and badly maintained. Dev's don't listen to the players and just do things to the game nobody wanted. What players asked: New missions and 128-tick servers. What do we get? We get some nice updates of never wanted gloves with free game breaking addons. Oh how about we give you a nice new sound system nobody wanted just because we can. Let's talk about the VAC system (Valve Anti Cheat): Probally one of the worst working anti cheat systems out there. People can go spinbotting / wallhacking ingame without insta triggering red flags, no they just get a some people in overwatch after 10 reports looking at it. Instead of building a better VAC system to help keep the game fun and fair, they give us gloves and game breaking addons. But I guess if they made the VAC system better half of the pro's out there get insta banned and then it's bye bye CS:GO.   Soon 1.000 hours for me, never had a higher then 0.03€ skin drop, a friend of mine played, gets a 250€ M4A1-S drop with his first deathmatch... It's random but maybe recode it so things like this don't happen because it absolut BS. But after all, I enjoy the game even tho 1/3 games gives a hacker and 1/2 games give a high chance of dropping you in a game full of russians. VALVE, fix your game like the PEOPLE want it: - 128-tick servers - Better VAC system, even tho half the pro's gets banned - Fix bugs in the game / maps instead of adding gloves just to get more money - Different servers for RU / EU with no way to mix those together - Fix those damn hitboxes - Add that's it recommended to have a microphone and have some basic English knowledge. Game: 8/10 Good game in general, could use some better hitboxes Maps: 7/10 Some maps just have so low FPS for people it's unplayable Dev's: 5/10 Give a lot broken updates but fixes them more or less within 2 weeks Servers: 6/10 Some Valve servers are laggy and they should be split between RU / EU / Asia / US   Total: 6.5/10 Would I buy it again?: To play a broken game with russians? Hell yeah! 10/10 would buy again."

.Erin.,True,"Counter Strike: Global Offensive   Everyone starts with the same thoughts when they play CS:GO:  1) 'Pfft. I'm never going to spend money in game buying skins and keys, that's stupid' 2) I'm never going to get that angry, it's only a game.  3) 'Meh, doesn't look that hard' Within a week -  1) You’ve already have bought a P90 module skin because ""Oh, It's only 30p"" and you begin your slow downward spiral into the CS:GO marketplace, saving up for a knife and opening crates, in hopes of getting a knife which (deep on the inside, deep deep down) you know you're never going to get, and end up spending £10 opening crates, and getting back 50p worth of skins back.   2) You’ve probably already threatened a handful of people with their lives; it’s a game that can turn any lovely human being into a   within minutes of a match starting.  Get used to wanting to assassinate everyone in your near vicinity.  3) You'll already gave uninstalled the game at   twice, in utter exasperation and in utter hope of cleansing your life from this game.   you'll always go back. The community is   with over half the people being angry 12 year old Russians. The betting will completely waste you and rip you of all of your favourite 50p worth of skins. And the trading is completely unreliable, leaving you to deal with steam support, which is 10x more brutal than the game itself.  But of course you’ll go back, it’s CS:GO, it’s a drug. A soul destroying, mind numbing, murder spree inducing drug.  HA. Oops."

0118 999 881 999 119 725 3,True,"I'm bored and have slow internet. Might as well make a review. I don't even know if this IS a review. > spends 1 hour writing this > nobody reads > :c  is a pretty great game. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-   First things first, the basic rules. In  , you have the choice to play five official gamemodes: -Arms Race -Deathmatch -Demolition -Casual -Competitive -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- Summary of gamemodes:  In Arms Race, the player gets weapons not by the money, but by killing people. Each two kills get you a new weapon. At the final stage of the weapon, you will get the Gold Knife. Kill someone with it, and you win. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- Deathmatch, yes. In Deathmatch, it is like a ""warm-up"" or ""practice"" mode. For me, at least. In this gamemode, you join a server, and you just kill everybody you see, except your teammates. You can get weapons for free. There are also random occasions in which the game will tell you that a weapon currently has bonus points, and if you want to use that particular weapon, you press g by default. The person who gets the most points, wins. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- So next in the list, is Demolition. It is set to be a 5 vs 5 match. It also has 20 rounds. The first team to get 11 rounds wins, and it can even finish with a tie. In the first half, you play as a set team. In the second, you play as the other team. You cannot buy any weapons, but instead, you get weapons by killing people, just like in Arms Race. Money is also not rewarded.  But this is different: let's make a scenario. In (Round 1), you kill an enemy. the weapon will be rewarded to you on the next round. But what if you kill two in one round? You still get to advance to the next weapon, but you get a bonus grenade. For example: 2 kills: next wep + bonus grenade 3 kills: next wep + 2 bonus grenades Get the pattern? Yeah.  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- What next? Oh, yeah. It's Casual.  Casual is a 10vs10 game, with 15 rounds. The first team to get 8 wins, wins the match. It is split into two sub-gamemodes: Bomb Defusal (IIRC), and Hostage. Sorry, I don't know the exact names. In Bomb Defusal, there are two bomb sites. A and B. The Counter-Terrorists always have the Defusal Kit equipped, even if they didn't buy it. The kit shortens the defusal time from 10 to 5 seconds. The terrorists can freely choose which site they want to plant in. The bomb, iirc, has a 45 second timer.  When defusing / planting the bomb, it makes a noise. Of course, the CTs are trying to stop them. Counter-Terrorists can win in two ways: killing all of the Ts before they plant the bomb, or defusing the bomb. For the terrorists, it's the same: killing all of the CTs, or making the bomb explode. So in Hostage, the roles are switched: the terrorists are now the defending side, and vice-versa. As the gamemode says, the Ts are holding some people hostage. And it is up to the CTs to get the hostages, or kill all of the Ts. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- Finally, competitive. The competitive gamemode is much like the Casual gamemode, except a few differences: - Each kill has 2x more money reward than in Casual. - Defusal Kits / Rescue Kits cost money, and they don't get equipped automatically for free. - It's a 5v5. - Competitive has 30 rounds. - Each half has 15 rounds, and in both halves, you get to play as CTs and Ts. - Like the Demolition Gamemode, the match can end in a tie. - People are much more serious. -♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- So, here is my thoughts. CS:GO offers a large variety of gamemodes, and you can just see that I've written about all of them. Phew, that took a lot of time. Anyway, CS:GO is a very entertaining game, and each match has a different experience. Yes, CS:GO can be a bit too serious, but it is also a fun game. The community is not just a single person, you know. There are people who don't like you, and some don't care, but some will make your day better. GO is a game with a high skill ceiling. There is a huge learning curve to go in this game.  It's like chess. Easy to learn, hard to master. I've met a huge amount of my friends in CS:GO, and I still talk to them. Some, I don't. Yeah. They'll be grumpy at times, but they inspire me. There are some bugs in this game, but not too gamebreaking. Just a few small ones. Don't expect to enjoy this game if you have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ internet. Ping matters.  I hope you know that CS:GO is available for consoles, too. In fact, VALVe talked about having cross-platform multiplayer, but that would be unfair for the console players, cause they have a delay in controls. I am 100% sure that VALVe completely abandoned Global Offensive in the console.  The competitive scene is pretty huge, too. And a tournament even reached more than a million viewers! Online and in the tournament itself. It's only two years old, and it's already a big game. VALVe may not be the most listening, but they try. Except sometimes they make some aspects of the game turn to♥♥♥♥♥♥ Like the AWP. They reduced the movement speed while scoping. There are also skins in CS:GO. Some care about it, some don't. Just a matter of personal preference. I think they're part of why this game is popular. The most negative opinion I have, though, is about the Competitive gamemode. Sure, ""no game is perfect"", and the real fun is there, yeah, but the banning system needs some stuff to be taken care of. You know, just a few tweaks, like forgiving a person if he accidentally kills someone. It is pretty unforgiving. For who doesn't know, you can get banned for killing a teammate too many times, or leaving the game. If someone abandons your team, you can surrender. Not permanent bans, though. The VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) System also needs some fixing to be done. Some cheats aren't fully detected, so the hacker doesn't get VACed. From my experiences, I still haven't encountered a hacker, but that's probably because I'm a Silver. Some people can be real ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. So that's my review. Hoped you like it! EDIT: I missed a few points, thanks > SKaREO About the netcode of CS:GO, truth be told, it HAS been really bad... for a few weeks now in fact. I go up to a guy and spray him, but most of the time it registers 2 or 3 hits out of 8 for example which could be lethal. Take note, that's in close quarters. No, that's not horrible aim. In the words of a truly horrible player, ""omfg 64-tick sucks volvo pls 128-tick"". Eh, doesn't really suck, just... well, mixed? In Global Offensive, there are a few advantages. Some on the T side, and some on the CT side. Hm, what's it called? Yeah, the perspective. Take this for an example, the ""left shoulder advantage"".  |   | Here's an explanation: the player models hold guns on the right side. Therefore holding angles or peeking with left shoulder is more favorable as your model is less exposed. TheWarOwl has this video to make advantage of your perspective:  |   | And that's well-- unfair. Just like in real life, should I see your eyes, you will see mine, too. As I said earlier, VAC needs some fixing. It's terrible. But again, I still haven't played with any cheaters, so I can't fully review this part yet. Thanks. Final conclusion: an EXCELLENT game. There's bugs and glitches, but it's a fine piece of work. Go get it if you haven't already have it. Already do? Well what're you doing reading this review? Go play! BTW: CS:GO has gotten an update where the voice chat quality has improved. Thanks valve! TL;DR: ayy lmao 10/10♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  -================================================-"

YEETMEISTER™,False,"After my 2000 hours put into this game. I have come to the conclusion this game became a money pit that will never care about the people who play it.

If maybe for once they listened to the community this game wouldn't be a sack of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Will this make me quit? No, because i want this game to be good but it wont be, EVER. So if youre thinking about buying it, please do not, save your money buy something worth your money like PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS which is killing every game out their. Look what happened to Shroud he quit Cloud9 to stream BATTLEGROUNDS and go further with his streaming career if you think you will be good enough to be pro, youre wrong you will never get there with the state of this game. Hitboxes are trash. Tick servers are bad. The community is garbage. The only way to play this game anymore is with a third-party service like ESEA because the people there really care about this game, and they know how to use good servers with 128 ticks. The only way this game with continue to live will be if they actually change things with it, But with valva that wont happen it took over a year for a new operation and only ever add cases causing people to waste their money on the rigged case system because they wont show their odds but ban the case sites that show the odds of the items that can be won. Yes there were scandals in the past but now people are more cautious and because of that valve is exploiting the people by making them buy their cases without giving the odds of them. This game is only there for people to spend money and make valve richer. They glove skins really? Is that a good idea valve giving people gloves. No. Stop making this game a money pit and actually do something to make this gmae playable otherwise it is dead as well as the professional scene."

Jaiminho_Rafael,False,"After no-lifing the game for almost 440 hours, i have come to a point that i must review this game in its current state. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a highly competitive game that focuses on team wo--. Really? You REALLY think im going to describe this game as the perfect cut gem of a competitive FPS out there? If i did that i might aswell have won the lottery and get struck by lightning 50 times simultaniously. Basically cs:go in its current state is all you DONT want in a highly competitive game: -Cheaters/VAC: Most of them obviously have been cheating for a long time, but what does valve care? The only thing usefull they do is milk their games for money until they are bone dry. I just cant get over that fact that valve hasnt actually ""noticed"" that their anti-cheat has flaws, but instead they keep realeasing more cases than bug fixing updates for the game itself. Soon enough we will have cosmetic boots, helmets , masks, you name it. (example of why the tf2 community is dying faster than a bullet train). -Griefers: Oh jesus christ.. do i have to mention that 5/10 - 6/10 competitive matches i go have ATLEAST 1 griefer that doesnt do anything but insult,generally discriminate or just flat out do absolutely nothing to help the team win a single round? -SMURFS: I have seen more smurfs in cs:go matchmaking than in the actual series that plays on TV. Basically this ruins the game for new players by giving them the appearance that csgo just isnt worth playing if you dont know how. -THE SALTENING BEGINS: Do you want to experience highly more concentrated ammounts of salt in one match than in a salt mine, Followed by a community of 12 year olds more toxic than the radiation levels at Chernobyl? Well my friend, csgo is the game for you! (Warranty for broken mice, keyboards, screens, headsets, desks, windows, and possibly hands from hitting your desk too hard not included.) -Servers: When i mean servers i dont intend to talk about the ping/lag and how salty it makes me in a competitive match to almost smash my hand agaisnt the wall, but instead talk about how most of the time i get matched against people from the other side of the damn galaxy. (This is good if you want to learn how everyone♥♥♥♥♥♥♥your family members/pets in diverse languages.) TL;DR: Cs:Go is something that gives everybody a different experience (Unless you are playing in russia). Cringy jokes aside, i think this game is somewhat addicting and pleasant in the long run. If valve ever decides to ACTUALLY update their anti-cheat system soon i will be more than happy to play this game more frequently. Cheers, James."
Heisen,True,Good game. However many smurfs and hackers spoils the fun at times. Also rewards/drop system is very lame and biased.
//#include<studio.h>,True,"Counter Strike : Global Offensive, perhaps one of the most famous first person shooter till this day. Here are the things worth mentioning about this game. This is the review in a nutshell. Pros : -A game focused on team play -Reappearance of maps and weapons -Competitive play and ranking system -Custom servers -Market -A high skill ceiling game ---------- Problems : -Hit-Registration problem -Inconsistency on the VAC system and concerns about cheaters and scammers -Lack of casual play with competitive game settings (5v5 unranked casual) -Competitive mindset and player base -(Negligible)Blunt and plastic gun sounds -(Negligible)Does not support Steam Pipe --------- Review in details : -Pros : A game focused on team play A fine combination of map geometry, weapon balancing, grenade usage and money management, this game requires the 5-man team to communicate with each other to defeat the enemies, which is why this game is popular among E-Sports. -Pros : Reappeareance of maps and weapons If you are a Counter Strike fan, you will like this game. You will visit some of the maps originally featured in Counter Strike 1.6 and Source, completely remastered with the modern day graphics and details. You will also get to hold some of the beautiful guns featured in earilier games, such as the AK, the M4, and the AW. -Pros : Competitive play and ranking system This game is a competitive game, so people you will be facing will be tough and not willing to give up, you will have to use your muscle memory to control your fire and your wisdom to outsmart your enemy, as well as communication between your team. If you like glory, then you will like this game. This game features a ranking system which fluctuates according to your performance in a competitive match. The Global Elite Rank (the highest rank) is perhaps everyone's dream, or for modest people, to become good at this game. If you also wish to be a part of the E-Sports, this is the game you deserve. CSGO in E-Sports is a big thing nowadays. Otherwise, if you wish to be isolated from the competitive scene, you can play some casual gamemode like Arms Race, War Game, Casual, Wingmen. -Pros : Custom server Modding is considered the afterlife of a game. Even though the game does not support steam pipes, it still allows servers with custom rules. Many community-made gamemode have reappeared on the server list, such as Zombie Escape, Jail Break, Death Run, Surf, and many more worth playing. -Pros : Market Not only you can have fun in CSGO, you also have the chance to make money out of this game. CSGO is known for one of the reason being the weapon skins. These skins are rare in the game and some of them worth a lot. If you wish to make money in the meantime, this game is for you. -Pros : A high skill celling game The weapon system is a hard to master game element. After shooting the gun for a long time, the gun will point above the crosshair and makes your shots in places you don't want them to be. By memorizing the spraying pattern and have muscle memory, you will have a significant advantage over the enemy since recoil handling always results in either winning or dying. Other than guns, you will also need to depend on grenades to gain advantages over the enemy. Not only do you have to know about when to use them, but also where to use them. Studying the map is always important since you have to position yourself according to the weapon you are holding and where you are attacking/defending. That's why this game recieved the popularity it deserves. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -Problems : Hit-Registration problem Perhaps one of the main concerns for seasoned players. Sometimes what players see aren't what the server sees, and thus where they're aiming and standing isn't entirely the same. This is because most of the MatchMaking servers are in 64-tick instead of 128-tick, something directly related to the players' aiming and movement. Therefore, where the players are aiming is less consistent for the servers and the players sometimes miss their shot even when they thought hit the target. Unless Valve upgrade MatchMaking servers to 128-tick, the problems will still persist and can potentially ruin certain people's games. -Problems : Inconsistency on the VAC system and concerns about cheaters and scammers This game is notoriously known for the large amount of hackers willing to pay money for the sake of winning competitive game, and the VAC system is considered inconsistent and useless by pretty much everyone, so cheaters are unavoidable. Be prepared when playing competitive games, and report any cheaters immediately. Marketing in a video game also means scammers doing various tricks to ""steal"" money out of people, CSGO is one of them. With some of the item worth up to 500USD, you will risk suffering greatly if you're not careful with trading. -Problems : Lack of casual play with competitive game settings (5v5 unranked casual) The official Casual gamemode requires you to play in a 10 vs 10 match, the other gamemodes include Deathmatch and Arms Race do not use competitive game settings. This may be a problem if you wish to train yourself for competitive play without risking losing ranks. (which I don't really care about losing ranks) -Problems : Competitive mindset and the player base. No one wants to lose ranks (i.e. glory). So people in competitive gamemode will do anything to win (and not in a good way), from cursing and swearing at their opponents, to kicking their own teammates for their disappointing performances in game. There will be a lot of flames going off in this game, don't set off a bigger flames by doing the same thing to them. Instead, ignore or mute them. -Problems (negligible) : Blunt and plastic gun sound. I really enjoyed the gun sound of the older version of the game, but to ""reduce ear fatique"", the gun sound has been forcefully changed from familiar and satisfying sound of guns into something I really don't like to hear, which is disappointing because gun sounds are something I wish to enjoy in games. -Problems (negligible) : Does not support steam pipe. Unfortunately, unlike other Source games, CSGO does not support user modding except for custom player model used in custom server. For modders like me, I can't mod the game the way I want even when in community servers. And yes, you can't change gun sounds. Conclusion So is this game good? Definitely yes, it is a perfect game for competitive play and it is a game enjoyable. But the problem isn't the game, but the playerbase and the developers themselves."
get fuckin greased,True,"You want buy this game ?  I'm gonna show you somes tips for playing : - Before the match starts, don't press accept. It's a test.  - The P in P90 stands for Pro. Like you.  - When told to pick up the AWP, stare at it and go AFK.  - Don't buy kits, this is actually team death match, the bomb wont ever get planted.  - You are amazing with the desert eagle, don't let anyone ever tell you different, not even the scoreboard.  - Very important: That thing attached to some guns is called a silencer, and you have to take it off because it reduces damage a lot and will get you more kills.  - VAC is a good anti cheat.  - Skins make you better at the game.  - When a teammate asks for a drop, drop them your handgun.  - Never adapt to the game. Don't betray yourself like that. Just do the same thing over and over again and wait until it works.  - Dust 2 is the only map in the game. There aren't any others. Don't argue.  - If you lose the first round. You MUST ALWAYS Eco/Save. Which means buy armour and an -SMG/Shotgun of your choosing.  - When going through doors, always make sure that you block the doors so no one can pass. - -- Ignore the hate of your teammates, you're pro and you're gonna get mad kills.

At half time, treat them like they murdered your family. (Be sure to take note of their nationality!)  - If you see a chicken in your gameplay, you absolutely must under any circumstance, kill that damn chicken. It must die.

Doug Dimmadome,False,"I used to play this game a lot. I really liked it, and at its core I think i still do. They removed some maps, i didnt see why. People say it was to reduce boosting. that day i had a boosting overwatch on mirage. A year went by and they didnt update the map pool like they said, so i started getting pretty into canals. Then they removed canals. In that time they released a trust factor system. A system that automatically turns off if you are queueing for too long. Their anti cheat doesn't work, their map pool is about adding gimmicky maps temporarily, rather than actually changing the core map pool to any relevant degree. In the face of all this, they spend dev time on adding battle royale. They make the game free to play. In free to play people cheat their balls off. New players have a worse experience than ever before. The game has glaring issues and rather than focusing on them, they add new content, and attempt to flood the game with players. It's hard to support this game anymore, makes me sad. Hopefully one day they build an anti cheat that works, but that day is not today. They talk about ai and machine learning and how it's making their anti cheat better. Apparantely its not good enough to stop actual spinbotters though. A toddler could recognize that isnt how any human being could play, but their anti cheat cant. Put the dev time where it counts, this game isnt unfixable. Right now though, youve just turned a whole bunch of people who were tangentially interested in csgo off it for a long time by making it free to play."

You have to go to third party websites which charge monthly to play without cheaters, and even then there is still the odd few. So if you're a casual gamer looking for a time wasting game this is for you, however if you're willing to invest thousands of hours into this game to try and reach the top I wouldn't recommend it until Valve sorts out their anti-cheat (Which will never happen).

HunterPARK,False,"The reason why I WOULD NOT recommend this game to anyone is because Valve has failed miserably for 17 years trying to make this game cheater unfriendly. Hacking/cheating is the worst. Seriously this game has a great history of people cheating and Valve tries really hard, but not seeing any improvement since 1999. Even recently professional players are getting caught cheating. I will like to say to Valve, when....... when will you guys stop putting your heads up your asses and start being less lazy on these cheaters. Banning them wont work for♥♥♥♥♥♥ You guys update this game all the time, but these updates are making us have less and less fps and for some reason, creating MORE cheaters. Why do  I have to pay for ESEA just so I can face less cheaters? My suggestions: 1. Make this game $39.99 (this will make it harder for cheaters to keep on buying more accounts) 2. Go to these hackers website and buy their cheats so you guys can keep your anti cheat updated. (they update this every week or so) 3. Make it so their ip address is banned from playing this game.

ProTrollCat スカー藩主,False,"This game starts by looking ok but after playing it for a while the disappointment is beyond belief. Valve is recycling the Source engine that was outdated when it arrived, the netcode is horrible, they don't give 2 about the community either despite claiming so. There are numerous cheaters on high levels causing matchmaking to be pointless once you reach a certain rank. Their excuse is that they ban in groups so cheaters won't know what cheat caused it, however this means YOU get to play against cheaters for 1-2 months before they get banned. The server settings are subpar and despite Valve being told this, they won't change it because that would cost them more. The maps are full of useless clutter the designers feel you MUST take part of. When the community made their own maps and removed the clutter so low end PCs could play, Valve removed those maps from the mapcycle. If you want to waste money on a shadow of 1.6 then this is the toilet to buy."
𝔇eadrose,False,"Lol, making CS:GO free and adding battle royale doesn't make your cheater-riddled game any better, if anything you have made it worse, well done. You've made it easier for cheaters to access Prime matches; a paywall didn't stop them from buying the game before so why would a cheaper paywall to play Prime stop them now.  Oh and by the way, never make a paid game free to play if it still has a huge active community. All of those people didn't buy and support your game for you to make it free when players become less interested in it, it's just a huge slap in the face. It would've been perfect if you had released Danger Zone as a stand alone free-to-play title, keeping the paywall and Prime status sign up for CS:GO and work to further improve the both of them periodically... but no, so a thumbs down for you."

Datsuke,True,"**UPDATED REVIEW (05/05/2018) LOOK BELOW ** Ok, I think is time for me to write a honest review for this game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is one of the most broken and unfair games I've ever played... but I still love it Why? well let me tell ya I've had some many feelings while playing this game that I've never had before like desperation with anger, rage,  happiness, sadness, adrenaline, etc. This game became a part of my life, I've met most of my best friends in this game, one of the most important relationships I had was built in this game. I've met every kind of person, the one that rages every second, the leader bottom frag, the Canadian, the Mexican, the Australian, the adult with kids, the kid, the furry, very nice people, the most annoying people I've ever met in my whole life, the smurf, the carry, the bad team, the great team, the ''grill'' and the list goes on. Valve makes changes without any previous advice to the players, and they make changes to the very keys of the game, like the rank system, a whole map, the gun recoil, the sounds of every gun, the whole sound system of the game, prices of some in-game items, and the community usually gets mad at it at first, but we get used to it anyways. What do I mean with ''unfair'' and ''broken''? Well, in matchmaking (prime or non-prime) you're gonna find a smurf, a hacker, a whole queue of griefers, derankers etc, Valve tries to stop this, but I personally feel they're giving up which is really annoying. Another example for broken will be the rank system, is so weird and unfair for some players, when you're Nova II sometimes the other team could be Nova master or Silver elite, or a weird mix of those ranks, it took me around 160Hrs to get out of Silver after the rank system update, even if I had good perfomance, no rank up for a loooong time If you're thinking about buying this game, you should totally start with a friend, is more fun in general, but if you're a very first time player joining a competitive game, I can't promise that your team is gonna be the most patient in that game, usually some players demand people that already know all the tactics and recoils, without knowing that you gotta start somewhere, but if you find a group of people that is patient and most important of all if they help you to improve your game, you should stick with them and play together more often. But don't think you'll always play with them, trust what I'm telling you, most of these people meet others and move on, but if you have a long term friendship with someone like that, you're incredebly lucky.  now Datsuke, all those things doesn't sound very appealing Well, maybe in paper they don't, but after experiencing a good game, after experiencing clean headshots, long range noscopes, carrying a team, a grenade kill, seeing a hacker getting VAC banned mid-game, clutching the round, getting a kill through the smoke, being called a ''hacker'' for your skill, laughing with your teammates is the most satisfying things ever, winning a close competitive game knowing that you perfom well gives you a huge feeling of success making you play more and more. Besides, you meet very different people, you listen a new accent every day, you learn a new word or a internet term every day, you learn something new in general. Other thing I love about this game is that, learning, there's always something new to learn in every map, every gun, a new position, a new boost spot, a new flash, a new smoke, a new prefire spot. I have 1,400Hrs right now of play time, and I think I don't even know the half of the smokes in Mirage.  So yea, this game is really good, most of the time, you're gonna see yourself ragging every now and then, but personally I think is worth it -Datsuke 1/29/2017 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- **UPDATE** Okay, it's been more than a year from my original review, Have I changed my thoughts?.. Sort of. The game haven't recieved much love from Valve, and Prime matchmaking is still in beta, about Prime matchmaking, for some reason the lobbies always default to trust factor which is horrible, and to my knowledge you cannot make it Prime as default (correct me if I'm wrong). The community is pretty much the same, nothing has changed on that note. Now, I have more complains on matchmaking: I used to think that the game itself is broken, I really did, I thought that the hitboxes were messed up (which I have a video example of that, that I recorded myself here:   watch it if you wish) but really what is really broken are the matchmaking servers, how do I know this? Well, I been wanting to take the game a little more serious, so I signed up for ESEA which is a paid suscription to other servers that are basically competitive games, the difference here is that the matchmaking servers are 64 tick and the ESEA servers are 128 tick, which is a world of a difference, everything is more accurate when is about headshots and all of that good stuff, and I believe ESEA has more servers so my ping on matchmaking is usually 60-80ms on ESEA servers is around 20-35ms. On ESEA the ranking isn't **AS** broken as matchmaking and the community on ESEA takes the game pretty seriously and don't mess around, which I really like that, however the problem is that it is a paid suscription which not everyone is willing to pay, so there's also FACEIT which provides the same service as ESEA but for free, however Faceit has premium features but payment is not obligated to play. So, the game is pretty much the same, not many fixes or changes going on, but I wanted to update this review since these third-party services change the game experience dramatically and make the game generally more enjoyable, so give those a try and they make help you like the game a little more, at least it worked for me. -Datsuke 05/05/2018"

After some updates it became cool, pro scene started it's expansion. Sometimes there was cheaters back there, but some were banned right away. In 2017 it became totally unplayable with cheaters in all games. Whole teams using WH's and AIM's, so it's possible to get some rounds with luck, but no fun at all. Every game that we start, we are afraid of getting cheaters again. Not even possible to relax or play like a casual human.

shattered fractal,False,"Play casual, play for fun... this can be a great game.  Play comp, or want to... take a pass. This game has redeeming values, but there aren't many to be found in the administration of the game as anything approaching ""fair"" in the competitive sense.  In other words, the game itself is very good, very easy to learn, and very playable... but Valve has made choices that cause the playerbase to tend toward toxic.  This is a hard and fast judgment of competitive playerbase (as opposed to unranked casual play) because comp is a better set of rules than casual (all fires burn all players in comp, rather than friendly fires don't burn allies in casual, for example). However, casual play being unranked and largely taken quite unseriously, people who cheat in casual don't get punished at all, since the only result of a VAC ban is that you can't play comp anymore, and any inventory items you possess will never again be tradeable or marketable.   As you can see, I've logged 1461+ hours already and I LOVE the game... and yet, this is a negative review.  Here's why: I've sold my inventory, save for a few items with memories still attached.  This game was a huge staple of my social contact for a year and a half and I'm unhappy about the place they've gone to, but when I call things what they are, this game has become a pig I just can't support any longer. WIll I play again?  Maybe.  Maybe this is short-term frustration... but when I look at othre reviews of players with hundreds and thousands of hours, the reviews appear to have pulled this game from mid-90s uprated, to around 70  Listen to your audience, Valve.  Find better ways of policing cheats, and find a reason to keep the smurfs in their own brackets.  Start IP-banning VAC'd accounts (blah blah blah VPN blah blah, whatever).  Do something other than throwing us all under the bus - we who support the game and spend money in your markets, on keys, and bringing friends in with the gift of game. Making this game free with a PUBG mode isn't what anyone was asking for.  Thumbs DOWN."

Voodoolala,False,"I've played CS.GO for a thousand hours plus. I think, I've clocked in a decent number of hours to offer genuine and reliable thoughts/insights/feedback of the game. If there had to be reasons why i would not recommend this game, it would be for two reasons. Firstly, I have to say that the CS.GO community is horrible. People show no signs of mercy to those who are new (Including myself at times). There are plenty of rude people. Of course i've met really nice people who respect one another but that is just a small minority. Too many people kicking out starters from casual matches for being noob ( not forgetting many times people kick out random players to allow friends to enter the match) and many times sore losers who constantly restart the match just because they died/didnt get a kill/for fun. Secondly, the number of hackers and smurfs that are present now. These people are spoiling the game for those who enjoy some casual FPS and also in competitive mode. Especially for smurfs, I know of many who wish to rank up higher in competitive but simply cant due to the number of smurfs who are actively cockblocking them. And as for hackers, there are those who use it for personal glory or to use it to sell people ranking up services. These people are simply a real pain to the CS.GO community. Need I say more? CS.GO, honestly, is good fun. I do love CS.GO. I have spent many good hours with friends, meeting new people and killing chickens. However the harsh reality of the CS.GO is simply cruel and merciless with people constantly yelling at you and telling you that you're no good, along with a good bunch of hackers/smurfs who ruins your gaming experience. If you cant handle the harshness of the CS.GO community, dont start playing it. However if you choose to enter the CS.GO world alone, good luck. I hope you meet a few reliable and friendly comrades. Until Valve finds a way to counter the problem is hackers and smurfs (especially in competitive mode), I will not recommend it. (Suggestion to counter smurfs: If the IP address has been in a CS.GO server before, he/she will not be allowed to play in the same pool of players in competitive mode.) EDIT: Valve's implementation of having 24 hours cooldown after every 2 wins for fresh competitive accounts is a great effort in slowly down smurfs and catching hackers via overwatch, however i think a more full proof method would be required after once they reached 10 wins. ADDITIONAL NOTE: To the few who have disagreed with my review because 'It's the community you're unhappy about, not the game', here's what i have to say. I strongly believe for a game like CS.GO (in fact any game with multiplayer funtionalities), community is a very large contributing factor if the game is good or not. It is the community that makes the game whole and who it is, especially for a game like CS.GO. I highly doubt people buy CS.GO to play offline mode/bot matches. Though I understand your point of view, and that i should be reviewing the game base on its mechanisms/funtionalities like movement/gun bullet mechanics/matchmaking. However for my review, my aim is to offer my readers a deeper insight to the game than just what you see it on the surface/trailers. At first you might feel that the community doesnt affect you at all, however once you get into the game, i believe you'll change your opinion. If you still disagree, I think its either you havent been exposed enough or you're just darn lucky meeting really nice and legitimate players in your matches.  @Shadowdance You're welcome. You gave me the push to write this reply. Cheers fellow comrades."

c9q9md,True,Best way to learn russian.
Spazz1313,False,"Pros:  -It's a huge e-sport -very well done maps -it has it's own weapons system that's very unique and adds an incredibly high learning curve. -It keeps a classic arcade feel to the game so it's easy to pick up The game has seen worse times, but even still, it's terribly flawed. Cons: -Unless you're playing in a LAN, where everyone is in the same room, you're going to have tons of hit registration problems. -Valve's 64 tick servers are great for lower ranks from Silver to Master Guardian. But once you get past that, you've probably accumulated some skill and an understanding of the game and how it works. Quite often, while playing a competitive matchmaking, you'll shoot at someones head, see blood, and absolutely nothing will happen in your favor.  128 tick servers exist, but you need to go to a third party to use them, which seems pretty excessive just to play the game with a few less problems. -The community is the most toxic, vile, absurd- you know what. Just get a dictionary and every single word that has a negative connotation will pretty much describe the community that plays this game.  -Hackers EVERYWHERE. Hackers are insanely abundant and carry on without a care in the world. They don't worry about getting banned because they have no problem buying the game again, especially if it goes on sale, and just hacking all over again. This is probably the biggest reason Valve doesn't do anything to REALLY try and put a stop to it. But why would they? It makes them money when someone finally does it get banned so who cares about the legit players who try to enjoy the game for what it is, right? -There are a certain number of bugs and exploits that are in the game, that haven't ever really been addressed. For example, a persistant sound bug that sounds like someone is running when in fact nobody is there. (I believe they have fixed the running audio glitch but there are many more issues yet to be addressed.) -The developers put out updates, and just when you think it's something useful, like fixing a bug or exploit that's been making the game unfair, they just add more sounds! Or adjust sound levels! Pretty much nothing that matters to serious players.  Conclusion: The game at its core is a decent game. But you can't play it the way it's 'meant' to be played with just the game itself. For actually decent servers, and a SLIGHTLY more tolerable community, you need to sign up with a third party website that hosts their own servers so you can play the game. But those matches don't count for anything in the game itself, it's pretty much just a platfom to work around.  If you're going to get the game just for a time killer and don't plan to take it serious then great. But otherwise, don't waste your money or your time. I manage(d) four community competetive servers that are fairly popular, and I used to have a blast playing on them. But now whenever I go into the servers, it usually ends in me having to ban the ENTIRE lobby. I've quite literally yelled about how tired I was of babysitting because that's exactly what I had to do. I'm very accustomed to seeing hackers and cheaters from monitoring so many for so long with my time on the servers so when I play matchmaking matches the hacks are very easy to spot out. 'Professional' players have been banned for hacking before for crying out loud. The first few hundred hours of my gameplay were pretty fun. The learning curve made it challenging and different and that's what I enjoyed. But the higher rank you get and the more serious you play, the more terrible everything becomes. I've made it to Supreme Master First Class, (Rank before Global Elite, highest rank in the game's ranking system.) and I can't say that I want to bother trying to get Global or playing anymore in general. At this point, every other match has a hacker or at the very least a griefer or extremely toxic person that wants to spoil your day. Whether a hacker is blatant or not, it becomes pretty apparent when someone's playing unfairly.  All in all, there's no sportmanship or respect in a game that would do extremely well with both of those things, and the lack of feedback from developers in helping clean up the community or create better servers is very unsettling, especially for one of the most popular games on Steam. But you don't have to believe me, play the game and see for yourself. But you've been warned."

Pain,False,"After around 4,000 hours of gameplay since 2013 (also taking into account the hours from my other IDs) I am finally going to update my review from postitive to negative. + Great game to play with friends. + Balanced by competitive ranks. + Thousands of community server to play on. + Can make money from skins and operations. + Fun to watch eSports. - Very badly optimized, CPU intensive game. - Dumped with hackers even in prime, now even in MG ranks. - New players will encounter cheaters as they will be non-prime when starting CSGO. - Toxic community (make sure you have friends to play with in MM). - Really bad anti-cheat. CS:GO has 10,000+ hacks available which are undetected. I changed it to negative because I am really pis*ed off with the game, literally facing hackers (who are probably noob Gold Novas without hacks) every game. If you think they're just better than me, they all get OW bans within a month. This is been a problem with the game in all the regions, and Valve seems to take no action regarding this.

Ailaneee|小矮人,True,"OKAY WTF FREE TO PLAY , SO HOW ABOUT TO THOSE WHO BOUGHT IT?"
3kliksphilip,True,"CSGO is a near-perfect multiplayer shooter. Unlike the previous versions, which were often difficult to get in to, this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels. It has a large community and a well supported workshop, ensuring that this discount-priced game will be around for years to come. In short, you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round, which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster. It's been around for years and has spawned many imitators. The game isn't much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original Half Life 2 was. However, Valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis. Is it worth getting if you already own Counter Strike: Source? Yes. CSS was always Counter Strike shoe-horned into the Source engine. CSGO feels far more like a standalone game. Valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game. The best feature must be the competitive play. You cannot leave these matches or you'll suffer a temporary ban from the feature. After 10 wins in this mode you'll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill, meaning that the game is challenging but fair regardless of your skill level. These matches are exciting, occasionally scary or frustrating, but are the most rewarding part of the game and improving your rank is one of the most satisfying experiences in any video game, ever. There are all kinds of teams and communities that you can join. Really, if I was stuck on a desert island with one game this would most likely be my top choice. It's bigger than you can hope to conquer and has a huge community around it which will likely be around for years to come, something that can't be said for the Call of Duty franchise which is probably its closest rival. Remember that those games are full price and have another one churned out each year, fragmenting the community. Plus you can customise your weapon skins in CSGO. Surely that's the most important feature?! All they need to add now are hats and you might as well live in CSGO."

Hundreds of dollars later, finally you think you have learnt your lesson, to not buy keys and decide to buy a skin straight off the market for full price. Being still resonably new to the game, you click the unknown link, unaware of what is going on, you later realise that you have been scammed.  Thats right that skin you bought, more expensive then the game, and all 10₵ skins you have purchased for $2.50 are gone. Outraged once again, you start this process all over, this time knowing the chances of you pulling a knife and making your money back are extremely, slim, but you feel that this will be the one, lol nope get rekt son, 69₵ skin."
OhJesusNo TRADEIT.GG,False,The only thing which makes this game fun is skins and skins trading. It is being killed by valve with recent update which makes almost impossible to trade skins. Nothing interesting with this game anymore.
Senarin,False,"Let me preface this just a bit. I love Counter-Strike. I've met so many cool people over the years I've played, had so many laughs and good times, it's been a blast. However, I'd say about 95% of that was purely through casual.  So after 500+ hours in the game, I decided to try and get into the competitive scene. I got a few buddies together and we were gradually progressing through the silver ranks (I know call me bad,♥♥♥♥♥♥ etc.) and we were having good fun. We'd win 3, lose 1, but the point was that it was fun. However, as we got higher and higher up, it stopped being fun. The reason? Absolutely♥♥♥♥♥♥poor matchmaking and security from Valve's end. I can understand one bad game or 2, but it got to the point where it was consitently terrible. At this point I had stopped queing with less than a full lobby. Me and a couple friends would get qued up with people with 900 ping who were basically worse than bots, they'd leave, and then its a 3v5 for the entire match. Experiences like this, are not fun, at all.  The worst part though, is the amount of painfully obvious hackers in this game. VAC is the poorest ♥♥♥♥ing excuse for an anti-cheat system I've ever seen. One hacker will basically carry an entire team, and 9/10 times the enemy team won't have the integrity to kick the blatant hacker, because he'll carry them to the next rank. The most you can do is report them, but with how cheap this game is, it's no problem for people to make another account and rinse-repeat.  Valve makes more than enough money on this game to justify having a better anti-cheat system. It is honestly one of the saddest examples of a company not giving a♥♥♥♥♥♥about their community that I can think of in the gaming industry. Say what you want about EA being a money hungry ♥♥♥♥♥♥ company that hates their fans, I guarantee you that you won't run into as many hackers on official Dice Battlefield servers than you will an official CSGO server. That's just sad.  Again, I love this game. If you want to play casual or community or what have you, you'll probably have a great time learning the quirks of the game, learning the maps, and engaging with the goofy♥♥♥♥♥community I've come to love/hate. However, the competitive scene is pure cancer. I do hope that Valve reads these, even though I highly doubt it, because I truly want what's best for this game.  Tks for reading. -Sen"
Ƥyrefeather,False,"I ignored this game for so long hoping it would get better but it hasn't. It shockingly got even worse. Tl;DR - Toxic community full of cheaters and micro transactions. Before I start lets get into the history of Counter Strike. The Original CS was a fun competitive game that still remains superior to it's sequel, CS:source. CS:source was popular mainly because of the large amounts of custom maps that were flooded into the game but killed competitive CS and turned the game into a casual shooter. Then CS:GO came.  This game was made solely for micro transactions, but to be honest any game made by valve will be from now on. But the game has no major changes from cs:source other than skins and cosmetics. Furthermore these weapon skins and cosmetics feel like something that fits more in tf2. Bright pink guns and meme stickers make me want to vomit. But hey, if you want to spend $300 on a knife skin that you will never use or get a kill on be my guest. Another problem are the guns. None of them are balanced in the game. Most famous one being the awp, the 1 shot 1 kill weapon. And last we have the matchmaking. It is some of the worst matchmaking I have ever seen. Any game where it takes over 5min. to get into a match fails, and cs:go has no excuse seeing as how as of this review it is the second most played game on steam. And lastly the main reason I hate this game, is the community. This stuff is normal when you play this game because 75% of everyone playing it is some annoying kid with some kind of meme name. On top of that this game is full of Russians that like to yell. A lot. Now you would think that when you play on a west coast server Russians wouldn't join because bad ping, but they do. And then you would KNOW Russians wouldn't join on an east coast server because it is on the other side of the world and they would get the worst possible ping, but they still do. It's almost as if they are only joining these games so they can yell at people and not play the game at all.  30% of all the nearby servers, at least where I live, are idle servers and even then there aren't that many servers to begin with and it confuses me because this game has pretty much the same amount of servers as tf2 even though there are a lot more people who play this, at least to what steam says in their stats. And lastly this game is full of cheaters. And having a ranking system where you get better ranks depending on your k/d ratio will always make more dumb kids want to cheat. And having next to no defenses against kids cheating because you can almost never confirm if this kid is hacking or just lucky because you pretty much instantly die if you get shot in the head with any weapon. This game it is best used just to idle for the chance of getting a drop you can sell for 30$. With that said I'm done. I would like to remind anyone reading this that this is my opinion of the game and everyone has different opinions. And yes, ik, my opinion is shít and i'm an under-aged-pleb that clearly knows nothing about video games. No need to sprinkle your salt in the comments."
My Little Amnesia,False,"Stop Trade Hold, this is not helping the community"
TheJetix,False,"I've been playing this game for 2 years and this is the first time i actually dissapointed on the security of the game. Since it becomes F2P many trolling player use this advantage to use hacks to ruined other player experience. If valve doesnt notice this,then definately CSGO IS DEAD"
SpaceCat77,False,"Never met a single Russian in multiplayer. Highest rank I ever got was MG2 before the ranking system update and MG1 afterwards for hundreds of hours making me quit this game along with toxic community (smurfs, throwers, queuers that bring lower ranks into matches etc. etc.) Cheating is common no matter the rank due to VAC being useless. After almost 800 hours I do not recommend this game.   First I will be adding this onto the review due to the people that just complain in the comment section over my choice. - Say what you want but insults get you nowhere. Calling me a ♥♥♥♥♥ or a snowflake for not liking the game because I didn't achieve a better rank than you just shows to me how high of a pedestal you have put yourself on (I delete those comments that are just insults for now until I stop caring to do so). This is my opinion and you have yours but insulting me and telling me to use third party companies to make the comp. aspect of the game better isn't what I feel should be needed for this popular of a game. I have spent my time and made my decision and this is it. These are my thoughts and I am being as blunt as I feel is needed. Plain ole ghadilli puts it into better words and i'll post them below.  ""The game is not fun, it is not rewarding to play, you will not enjoy yourself, you will not make any significant progress in the complete abortion of a competetive ladder, and you will hate yourself because of it. You will spend your practice time either alone wishing you didn't care, or surrounded by players better than you that would rather call you a retard than actually offer any tangible piece of useful advice. You will spend your 'real' play time surrounded by people who have clearly not put in the practice you have, or at least don't seem to put it to use, and wonder why you ever bothered in the first place.  You will spend yet more of your time watching professional matches and thinking to yourself either, 'I could do that,' or, 'I could never do that.' But it doesn't matter either way, because you'll never get the chance. The competition to become a professional is so fierce that you have better odds at surviving a stroll across a busy eight lane highway than even approaching the professional level. Valve is so bad at communicating with their (unreasonably dedicated) community that it is sometimes physically painful when Valve releases an update to the game. Thinking back on all of the bad decisions Valve has made with the game, and all of the (actually quite straight-forward) things that the community wants and has still yet to receive after almost five years of asking, I sometimes find it impossible to believe that people not only don't hate Valve the way that they hate EA or Ubisoft, but in fact still defend and adore them. The AWP nerf, the overpowered CZ, the overpowered AUG, the ♥♥♥♥ing R8 revolver, the timer changes, the coaching decision, the lifetime ban of players for throwing an ultimately meaningless match in a tournament completely unrelated to valve, the rifle nerfs, the completely broken pistols, the new sounds, the completely and utterly broken Tec-9, and oh yeah, the ♥♥♥♥ing pocket AWP that one shots people in the chest for $850, and the list goes on and on. Oh but, they fixed the hitboxes once and so we love them! And all of this is leaving aside ♥♥♥♥ing skins. Talk about a way to make a game immediately turn into actual toxic waste: add an in-game economy based on paying $2.50 for a spin on a virtual slot machine that will overwhelmingly contain a skin worth approximately 10% of the price you paid to acquire it. If you want a surefire way to make sure your game rakes in hundreds of millions of dollars a year and simultaneously make sure that nobody playing your game gives a single♥♥♥♥♥♥about the game itself, there's no simpler system than a virtual goddamned casino. But, you know, they made the game so, like, good for Valve! Let's have a round of applause for Valve, the company that singlehandedly turned an entire generation into gambling addicts!  This game is a broken pile of neglected♥♥♥♥♥♥with no redeeming qualities, barring an unintended engine exploit dating back to 1996, that the current devs have tried their best to kill anyways. Do not buy this game if you value your time, your mental health, your money, or your morality."""
oguzha,False,"This game was released in 2012. we are in 2090, cheating is still going on"
LemonTree. #Tilterlich,False,"Absolutely not recommendable because of the insane ammount of hackers. Today i dropped From Global Elite to supreme and lost 3 games on SMFC against Rage Hacking kids. In one game we were 8:4 ahead and 1 opponent left, joined back 3 rounds later jsut to announce he quickly downloaded a hack. So after he ragecarried the remaining rounds getting 11 MVPs we obviously lost.  Don't get me wrong there are some strong players in this game who hit insane shots but with my almost 6 k hours of Counterstrike experience i can tell you that at least 5/7 matches have one hacker +, not even counting the insane amount of players using some kind of radar hack.  In fact Valve doesn't even care. Do they try getting rid of the Hacker Problem? No, not really. Instead they keep adding skins and cases you have to pay for.  Overwatch function seemed nice in the early state, but watching an overwatch session, you can't hear the ingame voice chat, which pretty much makes it useless. How do you want to hear if some1 keeps playing music ingame, uses a microphone of 1937 or keeps flaming? Or a hacker calling ingame? No, all you can see is a Scoreboard and the PoV of the Suspect, of course  you are not able to switch the teammates.  Counterstrike Anti-Cheat is so damn useless, a friend with 1 year programming experience was able to build a hack, which was undetected for over 2 years. Another problem ist the community. Most players below LEM  are queueing with 2+ mates only speaking their own explicit language. So why the hell is there no ""Team-Language"" Option ingame to fix these kind of things? All in all CS-GO is a  nice skill-based shooter with high potential, being ruined by a company only interested in milking the cow and a highly toxic community. To enjoy this game you would actually need to buy ESEA or just not play any kind of competative matches, which would make cs go kind of senseless. Cheers"

It is meant to be played with team where everyone can enjoy. Worst kind of community there can be which promote hacks and people willingly use them ingame. VAC is so lame it cannot detect anything. Overwatch was meant to put hackers to Justice but community is busy getting boosted and buying stupid skins that they don't bother to see the case which can stop a potential hacker.

Honestly, I don't think we can say CS:GO is a game anymore - It's a sport. I fully got into this game through the competitive esport side, watching my favourite teams and players compete is just amazing and I think this has to be the most gripping, exciting sport to watch due the the unpredictablility.  You can't deny that Counter-Strike has the best shooter mechanics of any game out there, and the tactical side is genius. Being a skilled aimer does not get you nearly as far as being smart and knowing all of the maps better than your opponent. It really is sad that CS:GO has made such a bad name for itself due to the gambling issues and Valve's lack of cooperation, but somehow it is still one of the most played games on the platform. Counter-Strike excites me and it will 100% excite anyone who gets fully into it, because you can never beat the game.  ♥♥♥♥ what a cheesy review"
Sonozaki,True,"Love it or hate it. I do both. Police versus Terrorists. You play on either of this sides. Differenced in gameplay: You want to secure something from beeinng blown up or blew it up. Alternative you have to secure hostages or stop the SWAT securering them. Easy to learn but hard to master. Forget about running with an Assault Rifle and give headshots to everyone like in other FPS. For this you have to choose the P-90.  No seriously it took some time to know how to control the spray of your weapons. Just pressing the fire button is not enough here. CS is still one of the most skill and game-sense required games. To help you mastering this you can download and play training maps from the workshop. (Smokes,Flashes,Recoil,Aim) Difficult! There are a lot of nice people but also the most toxic guys you can imagine. Stay calm & be friendly (at least try to be). And for the sake of your money do not open any cases! ♥♥♥♥♥/10"

m i y a w a v e #MRGA,False,"TLDR: game with full potential: 7,5/10, game with community on most days: 3/10 What is CS:GO? It is a game that uses mechanics that were last common around the year 2000, or rather around then some mechanics were absent in most big shooter titles that are still absent in CS:GO: no aiming down the sights or zooming in for most weapons, no sprinting, no leaning around corners, no weapon bashing, RNG plays somewhat a role while firing (that is how I explain how I have not killed some people at point blank range but I have scored headshots while jumping around spraying in peoples’ general directions…). What is good about it? I like the basic idea: short and sweet rounds that require a plan to win. One team needs to secure an objective (most commonly plant and detonate a bomb) in one of two possible locations while the other team succeeds by preventing the former team from reaching their goal. You need to hide well and rotate around the map in a timely fashion. Map knowledge and tactics theoretically get rewarded. This is a game that rests upon a good idea that gets better when playing with cooperative people. A thing you may or may not enjoy according to your personal taste are this game’s ‘microtransactions’ in the form of weapon skins and operation passes (temporary (!) access to maps and more skins). It is up to you as a player how much, if at all you care about these things. Be aware most of the community seems to be obsessed about these purely cosmetic skins and there are still a few elitists around who hate on people for not owning ‘nice’ skins (just a tip on what to expect from the community, more follows). What is critically bad about it? Valve do not appear to care about the state of the game, not the least about the community, or do not appear capable to solve its rampant issues. In the two years I have owned the game little has changed, except for the fact that assault rifles seem to be harder to stabilise (a so called nerf), a major competitive map that got reworked came out worse than before and at some point Valve thought it was a great idea to add a revolver that behaves like a one handed, one shot kill sniper rifle, except easier to handle (much to the dismay of those who care about balance). Also even in competitive matches I see players with high ping who lag. Match making in general seems to be off. In my own unranked matches I have faced players with almost a thousand hours of experience. More drastically, instead of finding an effective way to keep problematic players out they have added next to the competitive ranks new XP ranks and a system of cooldowns. So during your first dozens of hours of playing, you will often run into the game telling you you cannot play. Not being allowed to play a game which you have payed for is a feature, a bit peculiar how that works. A better solution  this game really needs in my opinion is a more thorough reputation system that separates the wheat from the chaff. I have mentioned the basic idea of this game is very good and it becomes better while playing with cooperative players. However these players are becoming (increasingly) harder to find which lowers the enjoyment found in this game immensely. When I start Insurgency, Arma or Verdun I expect to find well behaved people in each session. Queuing for a match in CS:GO by contrast feels like playing Russian roulette. Playing CS:GO on a regular basis requires you to become callous or unpleasant yourself to deal with other players. A match should routinely start with locating the problematic ones and muting and/or reporting these people.  In the vast majority of matches you should expect to encounter at least one of these categories: a cheater using practically universally available and easily applicable ‘hacks’, a ‘smurf’ that intentionally plays on a lower level than his actual skill group (and hereby denying the chance to other people of having a fair match and ranking up themselves), a ‘deranker’ or group of ‘derankers’ who intentionally make their team lose the match (with or without the full agreement of the team) and finally a troll, ‘griefer’ or other general kind of person who behaves clinically mentally underdeveloped. Only once have I seen someone who I reported get a VAC ban. These cheaters and derankers organise themselves in Steam groups of sometimes tens of thousands of people and Valve do not seem interested in banning or removing these. In general, policing the community is nowhere on Valve’s task list according to my experiences. This poses a major problem for players who cannot rank up due to being defeated by cheaters, smurfs and griefing team mates, hence being stuck in the lower ranks or “Silver Hell”. Before I summarise this review, a few anecdotes of what concrete behaviour to expect from the community, all experienced over the course of one week. - On a daily basis: players from the same few language groups of preteen to adolescent age that keep spamming the same expletives in their native languages to you and never share useful information in a mutually comprehensible language. After a while and some googling you recognise the pattern that they are continuously expressing the desire to have various sorts of intercourse with your female family members and so on. Also randomly ‘vote kicked’ by these inclusive groups even if one is the best player of the team. - Me: “Very nice people, speak English please”. Them: “[rude refusal]”. Followed by a whole match of shouting torturing my eardrums. Instead we could have used sharing information and planning to win the match. - Derankers throwing mollies at themselves in spawn reducing the length of each round to five seconds. - Two people claimed to be smurfs, they played with pistols only and when we were miraculously salvaging the match they started committing team kills, tried to get team killed, obstructed team members, initiated random vote kicks, demanded we would abandon our weapons and more such trolling. - From a certain bunch: “Mother Mary is a pig”, “ISIS attack Brussels, haha!”, “Armenian genocide is big lie”, “suck-a my brown [male organ]”. - A Twitch streamer with a VAC ban on a three months old acount upon learning I had two friends with me who were new to the game: “gtfo, they’re [feces], NOOB, NOOB, IZI, NOOB, NOOB...” Number of truly pleasant matches in one week while regularly playing:  one. I became interested in CS:GO by watching youtubers like Anderzel. However now I feel a bit cheated and I realise these people only upload the one in twenty matches or so that runs its course without problems. In conclusion, the game itself in theory is easily worth 7/10 at least which is why some well meaning people such as I want to keep playing. In practice this score gets cut in half or worse. Be aware if you want to play and especially pay for this game, you are agreeing that you purchase an experience where you undergo abuse from the socially unadapted in all kinds of languages from all over the world, revealing the true meaning of the game’s name ‘Global(ly) Offensive’. Some people say it takes over a thousand hours to become truly competent at this game. This game only shines if you play with trustworthy people. If you are not yet committed to this game and you have no four mates to play along, decide for yourself if you want to play something else, go cycling, have dinner dates, play with your children for a thousand hours instead of listening most of that time to overly disrespectful screaming (pre)teens who do not wish to cooperate."

Here's a ridiculous feature of CSGO, if you try to vote hackers off they just call a map change and the vote kick is forgotten. Nice. I really don't know what Valve's anti-cheat department is doing. How difficult can it be to detect someone that is bunny hopping the whole time and headshotting 3 guys in 3 seconds with a scout? I've quit MM, just playing public, at least there you can go to another server. Don't know why public has a report feature. It's not like overwatch checks public games."
Ravusalov,False,"One of the worst games i have ever played. I got all the way to LEM and i can say these things about this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥game. 1: Smurfs. So many that its not even fun anymore. Once you are higher up in the ranks you will encounter at least 1 smurf per game and they will destroy you. 2: Hackers are very abundant all throughout the game. You will most likely run into a hacker at the very least once every 10 or so games. If you legit think that there are not many hackers in this game, you are sorely mistaken. 3: The community is worse than CoD's community nowadays. They will make ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t arguments about the guns, troll, among other things. It is sad just how low some can go, if you want to see that low, this is the game for it. 4: Horrid matchmaking system. I get it, you can only do so much, but from the amount of times I have been paired up with people i should not have, or been put into russians servers, its just stupid. 5: Boosting. So many horrible players have been boosted by their friends, or hackers, or both into the high ranks. Then when you play with them they are worse than a bot for your team.  6: 64 Tick servers and horrible hit reg problems. The servers are not good, you will encounter many times when you saw your bullet go through the person you were shooting at simply because what your client saw, and the server saw, are two different things. For a fast paced shooter such as csgo, that is very very bad. All in all csgo was fun, i enjoyed it for a time. That time has long since past. This game could be one of the best of its kind if somebody showed it some proper TLC. Fixed up VAC, upgraded the servers. Helped prevent smurfing to some extent. Now im not somebody with their head in the clouds thinking that everything in this game could be fixed and it would be a perfect game. No, that is not realistic, some of the problems do need fixing though. Maybe one day Valve will care enough to solve them, but i find that to be highly doubtful. If you are looking to become angry, get violent with strangers and friends alike, want to have a stroke and lose your hair through either stress or you pulling it out yourself, this is the game for you. Edit:As of 3/29/2016 there are even more hackers than before. Wallers are in about every 1 in 3 games. Most of them don't even bother hiding it that well due to bans being so avoidable in this game. Ever since polyhacks were released to the public people have been walling like crazy. Don't believe me? thats ok go look on m p g h and see the massive hacking community at work."

haHAA,True,"I bought this game for the chickens, and was not disappointed. After exploring the countless lands the chickens have traveled far and wide, I realized their population was growing too large. The chickens had started to inhabit such horrid locations across the world, such as nuclear plants, and offices without cafeterias. I knew what had to be done. I bought a flip knife off of the steam market, and called PETA. I listened to In the Arms of an Angel in my Microsoft Professional Deluxe Gaming Chair 360 for about twelve hours with no response, so, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I loaded up de_nuke and started to put the chickens out of their misery. I cried harder that night than I have ever before.  The next morning, with tears in my eyes, I loaded up Counter-Strike: Global Chicken, and I saw a new item waiting in my inventory. My Flip Knife had turned into a Flip Knife Slaughter. At that moment, I realized what a horrible thing I had done.  With my hand shaking, I navigated my mouse, and uninstalled Counter-Strike: Global Chicken.  I regret everything I have done. I am writing this review to warn you about the chickens, and to let you know I have made a full recovery, and that I have started my new journey in Goat Simulator. Thank you, and farewell."
ThioJoe,True,"Counter Source: Global Office is a great video game to play on the internet.  Personally, I like to play multiplayer more than single player. However, multiplayer is more difficult because the enemies shoot back.  I think they should nerf the sniper because people can kill me in one shot even when i buy the helmet!  This game is very tough but fun.  I heard that the pros warm up before their matches by playing minecraft so that's what I do too."
Terrorban,True,"I love this game! If you decide to buy this game here's 10 Tips:  1) Your ears are your eyes.  2) Echo = Eco 3) AVP = AWP 4) Top left you have radar. Learn to use it. 5) The guns have rubber barrels so when you hold the trigger for more than 3 shots, the bullets will go all over the screen. 6) P90 was crafted by Gods so it's users are not hackers. 7) If you have the bomb, sit behind your team like a good dog. 8) The game's secret name is Counter-Strike: Dust 2. 9) Competitive is the main game mode but there are other modes for your little kids too! 10) If you easily get brain cancer just from losing one match STAY AWAY FROM COMPETITIVE! you psycho! P.S. I'm not a doctor."
TesseracT,True,Counter Strike Global Offensive in itself is a good game. We are getting frequent updates from the dev’s and the player count keeps increase.  Rather than writing a lengthy summary of my opinions of the game I have decided to break it down into two groups of bullet points.  **The Good** * High skill ceiling but easy to start FPS  * Lots of fun to play with friends / make new friends  * Many of the guns are viable unlike previous versions * Dev’s connect with the community and gradually make tweaks and ingame changes after deliberation.  **Needs Improvment** * Visibility (HDR / Bloom are locked down unlike prior versions).  * Upgraded anti cheat (too many hackers in higher elo MM).  * Movement and accuracy modifications. * Some guns need further tweaking (Deagle / P90)  * Valve servers need lower VAR / higher tickrate  *  **Overall Rating ** 8.5 / 10
The Elusive Nippleless Sheep,True,"This game is like doing cocain. When you first start it doesn't seem very appealing, and maybe it hurts a little. But then you experence this rush, and you have to have more. And the more you do it the better you are at it. You know it's taking up all your time, and you try to stop. But the game exits, and you stare at your desktop. A tear falls from your face as you hit ""play"" again. 10/10 would get addicted"

I have never followed the trend of buying useless skins for huge amounts of money, music kits,   it. It´s really beyond me how easily can most of you become so influenced and basically forced to buy more and more absolutely useless content for this game. But the main issue is that valve instead of fixing at least some of the ingame issues just keep adding more and more of that moneygrabbing stuff. I really donno why so many people defend this game. Yes, if you play with bunch of friends constantly it can be fun for a while. I have no problems with admitting it. Other than that, there is literally nothing more... - worst community in history of pc games - practically nobody cares about cheaters beside ESEA  - important ingame issues not adressed  - absolutely unlogic and unfair MM penalty system - optionable but massively overpriced ingame purchases - rise of the internet gambling and criminal activities Please people open your eyes. I know most of u will disagree with me instantly but try to think about some pro and cons. And i can assure you that in 2k16 there is definitely comparable or better game for any aspect u can think of. And if you really want to play CSGO whatever your reason is, play ESEA only."
Ack4orge,True,"CSGO is a competitive team based shooter with highly refined mechanics     (+) Gunplay is based on skill. Knowing how to control the rifle is the difference of winning or losing a gunfight.     (+) All weapons are balanced in the sense that they each have a time, situation, or role that they should be used in.     (+) Movement is fluid and precise and if mastered, can give you a competitive advantage.     (+) The competitive maps have been tweaked specifically for competitive play in mind.     (+) Competitive isn't the only game mode. There are also community servers which host a variety of game types that are fun and interesting.     (+) Game overall takes skill to do well. It's not so easy to learn, and very difficult to master. This makes it pretty addicting when you're trying to improve your skills in the game.     (+) Chickens.     (-) CSGO is hard. Seems like every bullet misses when you're aiming right at the guy. (This is where you would take the time to learn the game, but otherwise a common complaint from people.     (-) Hit-reg is messed up. I always see the blood splatter but it never counts as a hit. (This is just a problem with the default 64 ticks server. You can join other servers with 128 tick to get better hit-reg anyways. It's still better than the 10 or 30 tick rate that Battlefield and Call of Duty has though.) Well that's all the good and bad I could think of for CSGO. With the perfect tweaks to the gunplay, maps, movement, and gun balance, it refines the already highly refined gameplay of the past Counter-Strikes that's been out since 1999, making this one of the best competitive team-based first-person shooters on the market."

Yester,False,lol csgo is free more cheaters yeah Another great update
s4rde☺,False,used to be my favourite game but now its ruined. only cheaters everywhere all the time. totally unplayable. uninstalled.
Ashnard,False,"Well, I don't play this game, but I watch streams so I can write something about new update. Do you wonder why you have endless amounts of cheaters? Because your anti cheat doesn't exist. Before switching to F2P, there was a risk, that you'll lose some euros/dollars when you use a cheat. Now? There is literally no risk. If you don't want to lose your games, just create a new account. Feel free to cheat on it! Getting lvl 2 is a matter of 1 hour, you don't have to pay for CS:GO, so why wouldn't you cheat? To cheat, you have to buy a monthly/year subscription, so after getting banned you were forced to buy CS:GO again, if you didn't want to waste subscription. Now it's not a problem. Second thing, this game is out for 6 years, millions of people bought it and what do you give them? Nothing, just a badge or something. Really? This is really unfair for those people. You could give e.g. a premium skin, or just give us our money back, or whatever better. It's not that hard to decide what you should give us. I bought this game 2 weeks ago and I don't really care about getting anything, because I didn't play it earlier, refund would be good, but I won't cry for it. I'm saying about people who managed to not get banned for 6 years, that spent thousands of hours playing your games. Bad move."

VloCro,False,"Alright, it's time for a honest and sophisticated CS:GO review, no hate, just criticism. I've played this game since the beta of around August 2012, and I'm here to tell you that it didn't really get any better. It went all from a competitive team-shooter to a game that's more about the skins than about the actual content featured in the game. For example, we've had a few operations that actually added some new gameplay style, but then again, you need to pay for those. And most of the time the updates revolves around some case with some new community skins in it. (Valve to lazy to design own skins). And then there's the community, now I know there's alot of actual good people out there, but the majority of them are,  you guessed it, Russians/Polskis. Now i don't mind people from Russia or Poland aslong as they play normally, which is most of the time not the case. Most of the Russians / Polski I've met in game are just general derankers and or griefers. Personally I don't really give much about a matchmaking rank other than the bragging rights, but derankers and griefers just take the   out of my game, and that's just not cool. The most important thing about a game is to have fun, right? Well sadly I cannot say I can recommend to play this game solo if you expect a fun match. And then there's the new matchmaking system everybody keeps talking about. I've experienced it myself, I've lost a couple ranks myself, but from a personal point of view, I don't see much trouble in it. Ofcourse, it's not fun to lose 3 ranks if you win 9 and lose 1 and get deranked. But the real thing is, if you really have the skill I'd recommend playing other things than matchmaking. (like ESEA, FaceIt, LANs) I can understand that people get frustrated if they lose their hard earned ranks, and I agree with them that it's a pretty stupid update, but Valve won't revert the update anytime soon, so it's best to learn to play with it. Overwatch and matchmaking bans are flawed. Overwatch doesn't work because most of the players can't see the difference between a good player, and an actual hacker. Sometimes someone makes sound, and the Suspect just has very good sound so he hears him. Lower ranking players aren't able to hear or see this and convict him of wallhacking.  Matchmaking bans are bad because too much team damage and you get kicked. But for example, I throw a firebomb and my Russian team runs into it and stays in it on purpose, then I get banned. Also accidental grenades while rushing are also a part on this. As this review comes to an end, I cannot recommend this game  . It used to be alot better back when the gameplay actually matters, but right as of now, VALVE is only interested in filling their wallets. The result is a very broken game with broken mechanics, and not so community-approved updates. (R8 back in release.) Thank you for reading."
Nomus,False,Community is ruining this game. I live in Russia and happen to play on russian servers. This is incredibly awful experience i must say. Russians are the cancer of this game. They are everywhere and ruin the community and the game for others. I wish CSGO would cost like 30-50$ on Steam and that would definitely help to cut the amount of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in it. I wish there was an option to choose who to play with but again that wouldn't help because russians are everywhere. It saddnes me because i fed up with screaming kids and chavos and im quitting CSGO because of it. I can't enjoy the game while i have to listen to angry rednecks on the mic or screaming kids for 40-60 minutes. Despite the outcome of the match i still feel ♥♥♥♥♥♥ because they trashtalk 24\7 and rarely able to play. ♥♥♥♥ this game. PS. I must notice that there is like 5% of cool russians that know how to play and are actually nice but alot(not all ) of them are just ashamed to be russian so the hide their identity from others. These guys are a huge minority and this is truly sad.

Mr. uLLeticaL™-S-,True,"Must buy if you love FPS games! This game is all about personal progression, since it comes with a high learning curve, it's not about unlocking some stupid grip or scope for your gun. It's about you, that has to learn. The game is updated almost once a week with new features and content, Match Making is great when you are playing with friends. The real game for people that love to play competitively, with a team or just solo.   There are also casual game modes available for the people that don't like to play competitively, such as Arms Race, Deathmatch, Hostage and Defusual missions which can be played on casual style, or mostly known as public or community servers. These modes are great to learn the game, and improve your play. ◘ Match Making. ◘ Skill levels and ranks, play against players of your own skill level. ◘ Competitive scene, with ladders and tournaments. ◘ The CS feeling, transition from older CS games to CS:GO isn't that hard. ◘ Most old maps from CS, are in the game. ◘ No perks and other unnecessary clutter. ◘ Great spectator sport, easily to understand and interesting to watch! ◘ No pay to win model, all items are purely cosmetic. ◘ Match Making 64 tick servers stability could be improved. ◘ Game could use some optimization here and there. ◘ Cheaters now and then, but that's online gaming for you."

sad lyf,False,"A solid game. Very good shooter mechanics, Very little support from valve. All valve cares about is ""D O T A 2"". Only if valve focused on it's anti-cheat. The community is pretty toxic in CSGO.  I still remember getting kicked from the game for being ""noob"" when i was new at the game. And getting cheaters in opponent. This really leaves a bad taste to the mouth of new players and casual players, since they just wanna have a good game. Many people will say ""Go to ESEA or Faceit"" But 60% of the playerbase doesn't even know what they do. So it's not really a solution to cheaters. People like me just wanna get back from school/work and have a fun game or two with friends. Hackers just ruin the game. And the worst thing is, People don't even kick them. They ""wanna"" get boosted by hackers but don't understand that getting boosted will do them nothing good, let alone by a cheater since if the cheater gets banned (they get banned only 50% of the time) they will lose their boosted wins thus deranking. And cheaters, OMG where do I start, VALVE! Please F I X  your  broken game !  there are literally threads on the CSGO reddit spoonfeeding and showing how to fix certain things. V A L V E   still wont fix it. The fact that there is even an hvh community itself puts valve to shame.

BigT,False,"I would not recommend getting into this at its current state. CSGO has hit rock bottom with Valve's missed promises of game changing updates and their lack of effort to combat the terrible cheating problem. Bugs have been in the game for years and still haven't been fixed. Cheating is out of control. Over the past few years of playing, cheating has gotten worse and worse to the point now where I end up playing against a cheater almost every game. Valve implemented the new ""trust"" matchmaking system to combat some of these issues but its lackluster algorithm still somehow thinks putting me, with years of gameplay and 3,000+ hours, against people playing on brand new accounts makes sense. I really don't know why I still put the effort to play this game anymore because it usually just ends up with me regretting it. I guess I just wish I could somehow have the fun I used to have playing this game but it seems those days are long gone."
Dubz,False,"I've Played CS:GO since release and enjoyed it for a time but now sadly im uninstalling it forever. So many hackers and smurfs and yes even in PRIME, hackers are being more careful yes but a lot don't even try to hide it having 100% walls and aim getting headshots through smokes and walls, knowing exactly where you are getting 180 headshots through smokes and yes the dreaded SPIN BOT. can't do it anymore, pointless. *There are too many hackers in the game and there is no anti-cheat, no instead the developers have created overwatch where the players decide if someone is hacking leaving hundreds of hackers still in the game and also banning real players who aren't cheating forcing them to buy the game again or move to another one. *Prime does not work as there are phone number generators online so hackers and smurfs can enter prime by using a temporary phone number and verification key to get prime and hassle other Prime players. *The community is toxic, throwing insults about♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥peoples mothers and wishing peoples families to die of Cancer, and it's even worse for girls. *Some players mainly smurfs sometimes want to derank or troll so you will find multiple games where players are deliberately playing badly, messing about, team killing, not planting, telling the enemy team your positions. *So many smurfs on enemy teams can prevent you from ranking up even with a skill group as you may be GN-LE and hit smurfs that will openly admit they are global and just smurfing and you will lose those games unless you're with a good team. - This also means new players have little chance of ranking up as a lot of the GN players are smurfs from DMG to global. *There are now nowhere near the same amount of players on CSGO than there were last year because of the points I have made and because of the release of Rainbow Six: Seige.

Every 4th match is a cheater, every 2nd match u get griefers and every single, i mean EVERY single ♥♥♥♥ing match you'll see a flamer in your team constantly trying to kick you or just bully you into leaving by abusing the voice chat. The reasons that you can get kicked in competitive matches are so immature and sad that it's become a serious problem: 1.Ofc if you have the lowest score in the first 4 rounds they won't hesitate to vote kick you (even if your score is just 1 or 2 below theirs) 2.If you have the least amount of kills. Degenerates don't ♥♥♥♥ing get that, in a 5v5 match, there's always going to be someone on the bottom of the scoreboard. 3.My personal favorite, if you dont use one of the following weapons: M4, AK47, AWP chances are pretty high you're going to get voted off regardless of your score. 4.Along with these, every ♥♥♥♥-up in terms of losing the round for your team (failed bomb defuse, failed plant, especially if you fail a 1v1, etc etc) Bottom line is that the community is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the only way to enjoy the game is if you have a 4 or 5-man party.Any lower than that you are gonna be paired with one of the mentioned dip♥♥♥♥♥.

Each update valve brings out, changes the game for the worst. Instead of working on a solid anticheat mechanism, they concentrate on creating cases, filled with skins made by  the community. The prices for most skins are insane and totally unrealistic. 8$ for a game, but 2000$ for a texture ??? Good job valve at creating money from nothing, and letting little kids get addicted to gambling. CSGO was more fun, without skins. Skill ans sportsmenship should count. But instead: Fancy skins and cheats dominate it. If you never played CSGO and arent sure if you want to buy, my advice: DONT BUY!"

They are a tumor which you can't get rid of. They are everywhere. In nearly every matchmaking you face at least one cheater. Valve is doing basically bussiness with them by cashing out on their behaviour. Don't buy this game. Also all the weapon skins/ stickers/ glove skins/ sprays etc. are just terrible.

Maverick //,False,"Let's give this game an honest review. Okay I wanna start by saying that I am a CS series Fan. I have countless hours in CS 1.6, CSCZ (LuL i know) and CSS. And from all these titles I think CSGO is the worst of them all. I will explain my negative experience with ""Garbage GO"" by splitting this entire topic into 3 sub categories: Community, Balance, Developer Support. Community: The community pretty much consists of 3 main groups of people: 1. Easter European Children, 2. Normal People, 3. Cheaters. CS never had a problem with toxic and annoying communities however it all changed when CSGO came. I mean Jesus I cant join Casual because there is a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of kids running around and screaming, I can't play on community servers because they are usually 64 people cancer, and competitive just doesn't cut it I mean I like it but I don't want to try hard every time I play this game. Don't get me wrong you can find your occasional good people. But out of 10 matchmaking games 9 times you wish you never met those people. Gun Balance: Okay this one is good. Gun balance doesn't really exist in this game anymore. See back then we used to have the AK, M4, AWP, MP5 and Deagle. Everything else was either situational or a miss click.... See even though these 5 guns where super good and where the only ones used they where perfectly balanced with each other. Meaning that the top tier guns where BALANCED!!!! This is not the case in CSGO. AWP is stiff asf***!, pistols are pure PTSD!, riffles have either not enough damage or weird hit reg, and in general the gun balance considering SMG's, heavy weapons is just ........ JESUS! Take the gun balance of CSGO, but only the gun balance don't look at the brand only the gun balance. If any other game had this type of balance it would be reviewed to DEATH! The gun balance is garbage and everyone who remotely tells me that the gun balance makes sense I just wanna say that what they are saying IS BLASPHEMY!!!!   Developer Support:  After the AUG being overpowered as ♥♥♥♥ and the Revolver being a pocket AWP it is clear to see that Valve doesn't test updates like ever.... How can such a big company on one of their most sold games not test updates before they release them it is a mystery to me.  Even after millions valve received there is no working anti cheat system, and the only good content that is being released are skins which some of them cost into the thousands when kids in Africa starve. It is disgusting!!!! All the major tournaments, money and skins will never make this game good. If the gun balance and Developer Support is not there this game will awlays remain MEH. I am not a little kid you can feed of with some shinny fade skins. I am very very VERY! sorry what happened with CSGO. I don't recommend this game.  Try it out yourself and loose faith in big gaming companies."

Yellow,True,"This game clearly proves that Counter-Strike: Source is some Outdated Junk by now, and proves that the same formula that appeared in CS 1.6 back in the day is still enjoyable, if made properly, to this very day. Even though the movement and max sharpness of the mechanics has been dulled down QUITE a bit. I used to play CS:S just for target practice when idling for random reasons myself early 2013, but this game is complete enough to drag me into it. (4K h's by now) Even though again, i find there to be a lack of optimization considering how the game ran better in 2013/2014 (early), than today. 300+ fps VS today's 200-250FPS for reference. The good old killing spree MOD from 1.6 Where you can spawn many times, which was about getting the most kills against the enemy team as a team, (A clusterfu*k without reason) and the classic zombie modes that has seen a return + a ton of other older mods from the past was/is missing though. With some returning slowly but surely however, GO is looking to become the best FPS game purchasable to this very date. Thus, i recommend this game. Something i rarely do with anything. But even more so when you can get it 50% off when steam got sales! By the way, you can get all your money and more back if you sell the stuff that drops in the game on the steam market. Which include sellings EVERYTHING. Or you can waste your money on another terrible gamble that will nver pay off because you got that extra money laying around from cases you sold in CS:GO, since when they drop related to events people pay super much for them and stuff... 10/10 (My old rating was 9/10) since you can eventually get your money back selling in-game items you get for free, stuff you can pay for is pushed frequently, spicing up the game if you wanna waste some money on skins, while the rest of the game is top notch compared to today's modern sub-par competition out there. The game is brutal and made for SKILLED play though, so go figure it is in general better made VS games like for example black ops 3. CS:GO has stayed on top for 2 years by now on PC, and it is looking good for at least 2 more years heading into the future!"
rapatouille,True,Dont play at 3 am theres asians and russians
HomieRicky,True,"Years of playing overrated AAA shooting games with lens flares, blood on the corners of your vision, and blue everything have since taken me away from the good old primative day of filling in the shoes of generic swat teams fighting generic terrorists; of which both groups lack the ability to look down the sights of all but a few weapons.  Then I found Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.  Being set eight years after the events of the previous game, there are noticeable changes brought upon by the passage of time. For example, the cognitive ability of hostages have further decreased to the point where they can't walk on their own. Moreover, both the terrorists and counter-terrorists adpoted new-found language ability. Finally, as we've evolved from the black and white days to being able to see the world in color, the world of Source has evolved drasticly in it's graphics in the eight-year gap between games. Among the new things introduced are atom-wide ledges, birds of superavian strength, and a modernized Russian train station which pays tribute to the skillful, fun to play with, and polite players of the Motherland. Finally, Counter Strike: Global Offensive has gone above and beyond the expectations of being an emergant AAA title by introducing an economy system that teaches rich naive kids the harshness of the post-2008 economy. Bravo. I've only played a bit of it but I will reward this game with a 9/10 for it's advanced chicken AI and the hyper-realistic sounds they make when you caress them with knifes in a fashion akin to spreading butter."

Blank,False,"This game will give you low trust factor after 1500 hours of queueing with friends and not cheating - so now you'll have to play against cheaters, griefers, and the lowest of the low as a reward for giving your best.  The best thing about it is how they don't even tell you why. If you can deal with things sometimes being very unfair for no reason at all: Go ahead and play it. As a game it's still very good and very entertaining.  However, the few issues it has (intransparency about trust as well as cheaters - especially ""legit hackers"") are too much for me to recommend it openly though"

Shield Jesus,False,Why???? This game was probably the best FPS around in my opinion. I enjoyed it. Screamed at my monitor for dying. I loved it. But this game has completely nose dived into hell. FILLED WITH HACKERS.... and now instead of you know fixing that stuff they decide to jump on a trend and make a BATTLE ROYAL MODE??????!! Literally this game was amazing and then they destroyed it by jumping on something that changed the game completely. Its free now there goes my money. This game was great until they chose to not be original and jump on every trend out there. Thats what killed this game.

dovahbruh,False,"I actually can't ♥♥♥♥ing fathom how bad this game is, they took the core of a great game and absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing ruined it by complete negligence. I've never seen a sadder excuse for a video game in my ♥♥♥♥ing life, here's what Counter-Strike is nowadays You pay 15 dollars for a great ♥♥♥♥ing game, a beautiful game that has built up one of, if not the greatest e-sports scenes around to this DATE, but then you aren't actually allowed to ♥♥♥♥ing play it in its built in multiplayer function because of how many cheaters there are, i've been every rank from GN3-LEM and every other ♥♥♥♥ing player is a cheater, and what makes it worse is they are all closet cheaters, it wouldn't even upset me if they were spinbotting so i could just graciously accept the loss and move on, it's the ♥♥♥♥ing closet cheaters who make you think you are trash because they are annhilating you but in reality you watch the demo and witness blatant ♥♥♥♥ing aimlock, these kids will never be ♥♥♥♥ing banned, at least not in my lifetime, ive literally played with kids who have SCREENSHOTS of their custom clients on their profile who spin bot with ZERO ♥♥♥♥ing penalty. Valve care so little about every aspect of this game other than revenue it's disgraceful to even list this as a game on the steam store, the lack of thought and care regarding vac is almost impressive, if you want anything close to a decent experience you have to pay for ESEA (Which I do) but that isn't the point, it's the fact that between constant cheaters, bad hit reg on ♥♥♥♥♥♥ models, and terrible 64 tick worthless servers make the game unplayable thats the point, you cant even enjoy one of the best games to ever exist because the lack of care and polish, it's depressing Every time I open this game I die a little more inside. Thanks valve."

Kaizer,False,"Now, as you can see from my amount of hours I'm sure you can already tell that I've been a part of the CS:GO community for quite some time now. It annoys me that when I finally have the patiences to sit down and write a review about this game, that it had to be a negative one. I liked this game, loved it at some point, but it has evolved into a monsterious sh*t hole of a game. The updates are just getting rediculous. I have had, give or take, 1600 hours of competitive gameplay done and the ranking system is completely unreliable. I agree with most of the comments that say ""When you reach a certain rank, all you get are hackers."". I've read so many comments on how the community would like for VAC to be better and yet game developers are ignoring this call. Instead, they're making updates of which benefits them ""financially"". Like who in the world said that gloves would be a f*cking great asset to the game and that we needed more things to waste our money on. The game itself is cheap, yes, but the fact that the past updates has been about gaining money is beyond my comprehension.  Please fix the game, thank you. Edit: I see now the game has gone Free To Play and implemented Battle Royale. What the hell is Valve thinking? The amount of hackers 10 updates ago were lots but still bareable (around 1 hacker per 15 matches) and now you've gone and opened the doors to them. I am glad I left the game before the previous free-to-play update was released. If any of you guys wanted this game and are happy about the FTP, trust me, you're going to regret getting this."
gwarlek,True,"Apart from being primarily a game, made for entertainment and competitive purposes, CS:GO is also a powerful personal development tool. Aside from (arguably) improving reaction times and hand-eye coordination, it teaches valuable life lessons, including the following:  - It teaches you not to pay attention to other people's   opinions. ""Dude, you are so bad that last night your mom told me you were a mistake.""  - It teaches to keep your cool in high stress situations, when you have such an adrenaline rush that it seems to be leaking through your pores.  - It improves your judgment, decision-making and learning process, because the game gives you immediate feedback for any of your actions or inactions. ""Welp, shouldn't have peeked against that guy in the middle."" - It teaches you to take responsibility. In most game situations, you can only blame yourself when things go wrong. - It teaches you to enjoy the game, even if you aren't winning. You can't win in life, you can only ease suffering and have a good time once in a while. Of course, as you could probably notice when interacting with your fellow community members, none of this will happen on its own--unless one pays conscious attention to the situations in the game and the feelings they elicit."

✪ Hunter,False,"(Update 24th of december) It's just not what it's used to be anymore.. Community: COD was most likely known for the game with the most toxic community full of kids, but since cod got worse a lot of kids came to csgo and here is the problem. The CS community became more toxic now and it's quite Annyoing for people to have a squeaker in their team. Their voice isn't even the problem.. It's just that they feel like KennyS and claim the AWP as their personal weapon for the whole game and if you tell them to stop playing AWP, you just get a ''♥♥♥♥ you'' or ''shut up idiot'' in response. Now let's be honest, how many times did your mum get ♥♥♥♥ed by 8 years old squeaker? According to the game probably over 10 times am I right? Don't get me wrong, it sure as hell is funny to make those kids mad, but at some point, they become a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥  Competetive: I used to play competetive with a full team, but sometimes you just don't get 5 friends to join and you just start looking for a game with 1 or  2 randoms. When you and your 2 friends found a game, you realize it was a mistake to play with 2 randoms, because either they are russians who were boosted and only speak in their language or you get 2 salty kids. Pretty much both russians or kids is bad, because once you lost 3 or 4 rounds, they start teamkilling and as a result they mostly receive a 7 days cooldown. Then you have a bot in your team and the game is probably lost. You are starting to feel upset and you are frustrated, because this match was a failure. Elo system: Don't have to say a lot about this right? A lot of people complain about the elo system in csgo and so do I. You're on a 8 games winstreak and then you lose 1 game and get downranked. Having a good rank is everyones goal in CS:GO, but ranks don't really say anything about skill anymore, because of all the smurfs. Yet you're eager to have a rank like LEM or supreme or even better... Global!  Skins: A unnecessary feature which makes the game look nicer, but some skins just cost as much as a car in real life... I know, you don't have to get skins, but so many people buy those expensive skins and try to make other people jealous.. I think, it's kinda sad if someone wasted tons of money just for a digital item. Now skins are not just expensive, the other bad thing about this is the amount of scammers in this game.  Now if you look past all of those negative things I named in this review. Go ahead and buy this game. I won't stop you. This game can be a lot of fun with friends. Yet if you try to play it serious, this game becomes a really frustrating experience. CS:GO is broken, because of it's community and the latest updates weren't a big help either. Weapons like the M4A1-S that I used to play a lot are literally unplayable for me now oh and the messed up HUD in casual is still not fixed aswell as the spawning in teammates glitch. Hey but whatever instead of fixing those things Valve decided to add a new gun to this game. 10th december the R8 Revolver was added to this game and you were able to kill 5 people with one bullet. It caused a lot of hate, because this gun was like a freakin' AWP. They reduced the damage now though, but was it really necessary to add a revolver? Oh also. Save your ''just because you're silver'' comments okay? Thank you."

ZA WARUDO,False,"I will never recommend or possibly play this game again. Too much drama has been poured into this game, that it is sickening. We have devolved to a state of madness which has eternally damned us in the name of CS:GO. First it was the ridiculous overwatch system, which in itself was not a bad idea. However, when looked at on paper, the abuse potential is amazingly high. Then it was Competative mode, the worst thing to ever happen to counterstrike. Then there was the skin gambling scandal. I would rather have cheaters and griefers in CS:GO than have riciculous overwatch bans and griefer bans.  The update on 10/25/2016 they took tooo far. CS:GO had always been a grey topic for me, but now I publically denounced CS:GO and anyone who is a dev, mod, or manager of it. You sold your souls to this? Are you happy players? Is this what you wanted? 'This game' is a disgrace to what counterstrike is supposed to be about. CS:GO devs, you have committed what is unforgivable. Let's just hope this embarrasment of a game is forgotten in 2022. I have never been VAC, Overwatched, or game-banned. I am a normal player who is easily bored, but when tyrants take over games; I cannot remain silent. CS:GO has gone from bad to worse. Save yourself some money and buy CS:S"

Schmoes,True,"Both the competitive and guilty pleasure in my entire Steam library, CS:GO has captured both these conflictive aspects of mine spectacularly, as I've enjoyed over hundreds of hours, playing this joyous game. From the teamwork, player rankings, campaigns, competitive gameplay, music, replay value and much more, this game is a king amongst most modern, multi-player FPS' games and still going strong even over just a measly three years. Just like its predecessors, the player assumes the role of either a counter-terrorist or a terrorist, both with their own unique missions, depending on the campaign in general. The newly added campaigns, Deathmatch and Arms race is a great exclusive extra if you're just a casual player, whereas there's the competitive session for the more experienced, intense and determined players out there. With every match starting, you're brought into ''Freeze time.'' where you have a wide selection of guns in your disposal, just ready to be bought, either with the money you've earned by killing opponents, or indeed losing a match respectively, still giving the losing team a winning chance. While with your team, you could stick together as there are power in numbers, or go alone to face your opposing enemies. I wouldn't talk for every individual player out there, as I've seen power in experienced players. Trust me, I have witnessed a Russian veteran take down an entire army of 5 opponents, all in the same vicinity...and yes, he was a rageful one, indeed. I also enjoyed the updated graphics and more immersive game environments. Definitely pushing the Source engine to its absolute limits but doesn't go too over the edge to miss the most important aspect of any game; the gameplay. The gameplay is near to being absolutely perfect, as you can easily navigate, along with the controls are fast and (sometimes) responsive, on the other hand, the radar being very relieable even in the most threatening of times, since you can detect enemies close to your location and either wait for them or hunt them down yourself or with your precious, numbered team. Just remember to tune down your mouse settings for aiming, as it does help much more. The original music used is also a big step up, as it literally puts you into that zone of actually being prepared for one living frenzy of a match, each time around. From the beginning beat as you select your weapon and gear you will bring into combat each time, or from hearing the threatening tune of the planted bomb ticking away down to its initial explosion, the music definitely makes the game feel and look more surreal than it already is. And with an added bonus, with the Steam music player at its peak in popularity, the update with the musical kit useable in-game was a great move, as you can listen to classic music, as you slaughter your opponents joyfully. I've also enjoyed the gun descriptions that tell the real-life history and origin in a very formal, informative and creative way. The statistics of the weapons also help out the player to figure out what weapon they will bring out, either if it means getting close and personal with a shotgun, sniping away with a rifle from a distance and even switching to second-hand pistols, when reloading your main gun that takes precious time, along with how they flesh out damage with a great, controlled accuracy. As you can tell, this game serves many different ideas, strategies, preferences and possibilities to each and every person who are against each other. And yet another great thing to note is that this game gets multiple, yet fast updates. The homepage of the game mainly dishes out the latest CS:GO news, such as upcoming streaming matches with clans from different countries going toe to toe, or special deal offers on those elusive cases, if you're ever tempted to test your luck and hopefully get a rare skin to add to your growing collection of weapon skins. You can also create clans and watch your ranking system build up with friends and even create lobbies to secure that you will be in the most competitive games with your mates behind your back. But my primary complaint with this wonderful game has got to be...the community. Yes, a lot of aspiring programmers and artists do a swell job at creating fantastic weapon skins and maps that when judged are simply classified as prefessional, but I'm not talking about those great people. I'm talking about the brash players that exemplify the dunning-kruger affect; where unskilled players rate their own abilities much higher than accurate and compare other players, in a much more biased fashion. It gets annoying pretty quickly, so I would usually block the most revolting swines who do this. All in all, this game is a big, big, big recommendation from me and if you think I'm lying, just check top-selling games list at the start of the Steam page. There's a reason why this game is on the high ranking list, and that's due to its high and successful popularity."

GlassyTea,False,"Hi my name is Graydon, and I would like to say I havent wasted over 1500 hours of my life on this game. So many things in this game are broken, and id reccomend to stay away from it alltogether to be honest. The ranking system of the game is the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing I have ever seen.  The ranking system is based about 99% on game wins. I play with people in this game to have fun. They may not be the greatest, but why should I be punished, and go DOWN in ranking if I get the most kills in the entire game, but overall my team is not able to pull through. The game is filled with hackers, and ""smurfs""(people playing in a ranking lower than their own). Even with ""prime"" people are still able to get around this. Before I played with friends I was at an average ranking of Master Guardian, now I am usually around low silver-low gold nova. Overall I think the ranking system is horrible. Next I would like to say the Cooldown system is absolutely horrible. I have gotten myself up to a week ban from killing friends which is fine for me. But I have been getting better- not killing any friends anymore. Now I am getting banned from kicking 1 person that was AFK, and said he was throwing. This was in my first game getting off of a week ban. Because of kicking 1 AFK teammate I am now banned for another week. The gameplay mechanics are alright, but occasionally luck can be your best friend. The community is extremely toxic, and I absolutely hate playing with random people. Hence why I play with friends. I would reccomend you stay away from this game, and avoid wasting your time and money. Thank You"

zackawee,True,Amazing.
Vancouver,True,"Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years. For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues."
LordOfTea,True,"Counter strike is a lovely game with a lovely community, its a perfect place for a malignant narcissist to flourish. If you love friendly interactions from all sorts of Ethnicities then this is your game. Pros 1. You can slowly get the money you paid for the game back with 1p drops in game 2. If your rich you can show all the peasants how cool your knives look and make all the Russian children trade in their grain stores to buy a sand dune nova. 3. Kill Terrorist ( big thumbs up from American players) 4. A deep and engrossing story line and ranking system with so much context into the terrorists motivations. Cons 1.Terrorists are evil and no one tells me why, the game should be more politically correct or call them freedom, fighters. 2. Game is old and I cant kill ISIS, may change in the future if valve wants to make this game an immersive experience.  3. Lots of children with horrible voices that make you want to use a cheese grater on your skull. 4. If you have friends you wont have them long as you will rage every time they let you die leading to you pouring piping hot tea on your sisters face.  5. All developed nations decide to allow their troops to go to battle without body Armour making them spend their salary on equipment - 40000 immersion points. 6. If you are British there is a whole wealth of opportunities to hear constant slaughtering of your language and a barrage of Tea hate which will be most disturbing.  In conclusion this Game is Fantastic with its revolutionary graphics, sweet jumpers for some terrorist and a real look into counter terrorism operations."

DatWut?,False,"A game with a community which I have absolutely no hope for. Let me elaborate on this one: the game itself is fun. But given that this is an online game, the fun gets taken away by other players. You have trolls, cheaters, smurfs (=high-ranked players on new accounts to play against low ranks to feel proud of themselves), and generally other ******** who think smacktalking players who are worse than you is fun. Pair that with the salty teammates you get during competetive games, who get angry at you for not winning certain situations they wouldn't have won either. If you plan to buy this game, be prepared to meet the worst kind of people you can imagine. In other words: the players ruin an otherwise good game."

𝖑𝖊𝖔𝖓𝖊𝖓☭,False,"CSGO is a competitive based Team Shooter. Its one of the most popular games on steam,and i dont think I have to explain the gameplay so lets jump straight to the pros and cons. Pros: -Many Gamemodes some for the more Casual Minded and others for the hardcore players -Many tutorials online to get started as a newcomer -Timeless gameplay that is fun escpecially if you play it with some friends -Big amount of Community Server if the standard game modes arent something you want -Runs on a toaster Cons -Many People you meet (NOT everybody but most of the time) are pretty toxic -Can get frustrating  -Valve Anti Cheat is well...not really working. It can happen from time to time that you get some hackers in Matches. -Smurfs/DeRanker and Griefer will destroy the experience often -Updates that debalance the game  -Valve is jut intereseted in selling skins and Cases As a conclusion if you are a hardcore competitive gamer who doesnt fear a steep learning curve or toxic teammates,and you can ignore the hacker/smurfer/griefer every second game. Then try it out. For everybody else it isnt worth trying. Dont waste your time and money with this game. And try something else! :) Thank you for reading. Have a nice day everybody!"

Aydenbush,True,"Making it this game free Is really bad. I tried playing the free version of this game. every match i join have Hackers. If possible, please take back the pay to play CS:GO. This is really a shame for you developers or whoever decided to make the game a Free to play. Now Hackers just taking over the non prime servers. I feel bad to those people who wants to play the game fairly with Free Version. They just can't Play it properly because of the hackers. If those hackers got permanently banned. They just make another steam account and they're back again. My Friends who can't afford CS:GO just had a chance to play this game. But they did not expect that they'll face a tons of hackers. It's just sad that people who can't afford the game got a chance to play this and they will have a really bad first time experience. It's just bad. I still reccomend the game. This game changing update sucks."
MightyHonk,True,"Best competetive ""guess where hitbox is"", ""99 in 16 hits"" and crate opening simulator for true MLG players. You have beautiful classic 10x10 metres square maps to test your tactical genius, truely realistic feeling of shooting with airsoft weapons with stunning purple camo and banana stickers on them.    Will i eco or will i buy after lost pistol round? It doesn't matter because at ""master guardian elite"" level and below your teammates will buy and die anyway and there's nothing you can do about it, since they're speaking on horrific Lovecraftian languages. Good thing skill levels make a difference and ELO works in team games, right? You just have to reach Global Elite or train your real life friends in special camps for 5 years to have competent teams and enjoyable rounds.   You can play on Dust 2, Mirage or Cache, because search for other maps takes forever, which is good because these  legitimate tournament maps don't reward people for ""suka krisa"" gameplay.   Weapon spray act just like it should: it works in preprogrammed pattern so you must remember spray of every weapon if you want to kill♥♥♥♥♥♥ because if you just sit with ak and shot static target right in the head, you might actually miss! It aint 1.6 anymore, scrub! It works kinda like japaneze Touhou games: you play for 100 hours to remember every pattern and then you're good to go to play on ♥♥♥♥♥♥ competetive servers where hitboxes travel in outer space and none of it actually matters.   Anti-cheat system works like a charm! People can just buy csgo gift for 1 dollar at some web service, other guys can exchange it for a crate that drops every now and then, play 10 games with wh and aim and get up to ""distinguished master guardian"" just in 4 hours or less. Then you will be delighted to play against them as they rush middle at dust 2 making 5 headshots as fast as rmb can be pressed. But no worries! Since VAC doesn't work properly, developers added Community Overwatch where you can spent up to 10 minutes looking at some guy running at light speeds with negev spinning like a yoyo killing everything! Without even slightest reward or weapon skins you like so much you can do developers' job at cleaning off the cheaters!   As for the graphics, since Source they added motion blur."

PatrickS,True,"CS:GO is a highly competitive skill-based game. This is what makes it so great, learning the maps, all of the different tactics, improving your aim and managing the economy. This however, can be a long grind. Every map has its own calls, grenade spots to learn and positions to play. CS:GO runs great(although every updates costs FPS), has some good sound design, and decent graphics for an older game. Updates come regularly to add stuff and valve keeps improving the game. A big downside of CS:GO however is the big amount of cheaters. If you don't link your phone number to the game and play in ""prime-matchmaking"" the game can be literally unplayable. This can be very frustrating, especially when you're doing your best to rank up and improve.  Aim and sound play an important role in CS:GO, More than in most other shooters. every gun has it's own recoil pattern to learn and it's own unique playstyle. Since CS:GO requires alot more tactics than most other shooters, aim is more important aswell. Having your crosshair at the right position means you can take your opponent down alot faster. Alot of practice, and playing aim maps helps and using your sound to locate your enemy's footsteps gives you a big advantage. The CS:GO Esports scene is also massive, milions of people follow it and it's a great place to learn. Use this to your advantage. Wanna know those new tactics, boosts and smoke/flashes? Watch some games! You can honestly learn alot from watching the pro's play.  Now ofcourse, you saw this one coming, the community can be really... annoying. Especially at lower ranks the community is full of toxic kids, people who have no idea what they are doing and teammates who refuse to work together. This can be harsh, especially because CS:GO heavily relies on teamwork. Thats why i recommend playing this game with friends, and practicing alot. The faster you're out of those low ranks the better! Once you get a bit higher you'll see the community gets better and better(with the occasional toxic/clueless player ofcourse). People work together, people give usefull information and are just a bit more nice in general. Next to competitive, CS:GO also has some game-modes for people who just want to have some fun and don't care about ranks or tactics. Gamemmodes like: Gun-Game, Team Deathmatch and Casual are great for this and the thousands of community servers offer cool things like: Surfing, Aim training, roleplay, minigames and more! Now would i recommend CS:GO? Yea ofcourse! Especially for the small amount of money it costs. Just dont expect this to be another casual shooter. It's a highly skilled game and requires you to put in alot of time to improve. Pick this up with a couple of friends so there is less chance to be matched with annoying teammates."

Genty,False,"After having played this game for many years, I cannot say that I recommend it to other people at all. Flawed ranking systems, peculiar and sinister teammates who are perpetually toxic, condescending or generally poorly behaved human beings. The updates occur once in a year, and there seems to be no interest whatsoever on Valve's part on the betterment of the product. Matchmaking and competitive play has become a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ where you have to hope for at least semi-decent teammates in order to have the slightest chance of winning a match. The ranking system makes no sense, where a person carrying and placing at the top of the scoreboard is punished and deranked because his team lacks skills and communicational efforts."
ezwip,False,"This was once the best game on Steam, until they dropped the ball. They created a juggernaut through skin drops which led to gambling and conjured the dark seedy side of the net. When it grew too big for its britches they cut off the gambling leaving everything in disarray. The games neglect was all too evident. All that remained was the crippled gameplay itself and websites that sold lifetime cheats and a terrible ranking system. Many will swear by this game but the truth is that the game is tied to a lifestyle of cheating and you are competing to become the best cheater. You are not to speak of this side of the game it is a not so secret club with a single rule, don't talk about it. That is the awful truth of CSGO where even pros are caught using hacks and major competitions are won by showcasing your unknown glitch. If this sounds great to you then this game will be a favorite for a long long time. After all Delta Force released in 1998 and people are still cheating in it right now. That's just a cold hard truth that the community wants to hide from their non cheating prey. For the rest of us we have departed in search of greener pastures and memories of what was, for a time, an amazing game. As the market for skins continues to drop due to a lack of betting skins on matches, the last of the fair players will lose hope as reality sets in. This game will not extinguish quickly as the the majority of players purchased lifetime cheats and have multiple accounts. This becomes apparent as you get better and more people turn cheats on against you. This is called toggling as they turn their cheats on and off just often enough to win crucial rounds. You will hear people talking about toggling all of the time and people complaining that they are too obvious and offering tips to better conceal their deeds. After all cheaters are just a big happy family around here. There is no strategy worth the effort to counter people seeing through walls. Who do you think is going to rank up you playing legit or a wallbanger? With that in mind who do you think is ranking up if hardly anyone is caught? It is obvious right?  If Steam ressurects gambling you may witness a resurgence but it is the loss of truly skilled and talented players that are the real story. Pro players voiced their frustrations over bugs and glitches only to be ignored. Valve released spray paint cans as some type of absurd diversion to the state of the game itself.  This games community is a toxic pile of lies. If you choose to doubt me and embark on your own journey I invite you to read the novel John Henry. That will be you my friend, with your trusty slam hammer, competing against a machine until you die from exhaustion. Such is the state of the game and until sites aren't selling lifetime cheat memberships with timers showing they have been undiscovered for years... wtf ever I'm done with this game. If you like scammers buy this and watch as you are bombarded with phishing scams. You can convince others that I am wrong but after 750 hours on this game I am not listening to it another second. The real ranking system: Cheaters on top Scammers in the middle Legit players at the bottom At no point will competition change as you will play the exact same people on different accounts no matter what ranking you are. It's just a big joke."

Linkjay,False,"The state of this game is an absolute whale of a joke. Valve has shown time and time again for the past 6 years that they could not give one single one about the community matters. Time and time again over this particular game's history, we see them not listen to the community. Honestly, this is the final straw. Nobody asked for Battle Royale, and you can be assured that nobody asked for a free-to-play game. or prime status to all. I paid for this game, and I grinded for the prime status. I cannot play any competitive games with worthy people anymore. I thought getting out of gold was hard before, how about when you can't be sure if that new account really is cheating or not? I paid 15 dollars for this game, but now anybody can get it? Sure, free-to-plays cannot get prime unless they buy the game, but since when has that stopped cheaters?  Who is gonna stop the 15 year old with his Christmas money and aimwar⁤e who just aquired a new prime copy of the game? You might aswell give prime to them already because they weren't being stopped. The game plays pretty alright for 64-tick servers, I guess. It's hard to say ""the game is good, community & company are garbage"" because the game isn't even that good. Battle Royale does not fit in this game because CS:GO's combat system isn't really designed for it. It feels like a rushed thing that they just wanted to do to attract more peoples' wallets. In short, the game doesn't really play as well as others, the company does not care at all, and it's just really not that fun."

Catto,True,"If you're doing too well, the players in the game will assume you're cheating. I find this very simple to answer why they'd think so. Because there so many cheaters in the game, some obvious and some discreet, we all tend to assume the worst out of everyone doing well in game. Because of this, it's frustrating for all, even cheaters assume others cheat. Unless Valve startes improving VAC (Valve Anti Cheat), this game is rather unenjoyable on the higher levels. It's even more fun around Gold Nova, as above that everyone's either too good, or just selfishly using cheats to up their game. Other than cheaters, I find that there isn't anything to dampen your mood when playing this game. You can choose which server to play on, through external apps. Don't rage when meeting cheaters or Griefers. We all have been there, just shrug it off and focus on improving. Or just take a break, go and meet up with irl friends. You've had enough toxicity for the day if you had 2 bad games."

Besides hackers, there are people in competitive games who make you want to rage quit or shoot them by blocking your way to not let you out of spawn on PURPOSE, therefore getting a 30 minute-7 day ban. And then there are the ones who kick people for being a different race or being a weeb for no other reason. It's horrible. I can't belive there are people who would do such a thing like that. I can't believe this is what we've become.  There are other things that i have problems with, like competitve skill groups, and the fact that i have met people who i became friends with, but were actually just pretending the entire time, or all of a suddon hate me for who i am. But i think i've said enough.  I would give this game 0/10, but because of all the good times i had with people, all the experiences i had in the 300 hours i played this game, i'm giving it 5/10.

C Λ L I B E R,False,"As a hardcore Valve fan, Long time steam user, and with 1000+ hours on record. I can't reccomend this game. Valve needs to communicate more with its playerbase, and the more people the support their actions directly against the community, support their poor communication. I love Valve. I've been here for 15 years on steam, and pre-date steam with the first Counter-Strike. And with that being said, Valve needs to stop ignoring the community and start talking to us. This update? Free-to-play? Battle Royal?! It's far from anything anyone from /r/csgo or /r/valve ever would have asked for. We constantly ask for updates other Valve titles like TF2 and we get silence. This game was the best FPS i've ever played, and now it's something completely different. The competitive nature of it originally turned into something much more toxic and tainted. Loot crates were added, making the game feel based on weath, and the more and more people got crates the more they felt superior to others. People turned on other people making it such a toxic environment, and the competitivity grew and grew. Hackers were always a problem, and Valve was only minute on the subject. And if you want to know the brutally honest truth, it's that I still love this game. But with a sane mind, I can't reccomend it."

Dawn's Spawn,False,"The new revolver is stupid. CS:GO is a good game due to it having barely any gimmicky guns but it turns around and adds this new pistol with the holding down feature. Also (apart from burst fire) why does it now have a new two fire options gimmick. Also (from my understanding) Valve has been trying to help lower level players get into the game; I came to this conclusion with recent changes to the rankings of players and such.  Another issue I have is the nerf that came along: The pistols were not OP in their run and gun status, so why nerf that. If valve wanted to be so anti-run-and-gun then why boost that to the SMGs in a previous update xD. Basically they have added a new overpowered pistol, but on top of that nerfed all other options. The reasons why the R8 is now overpowered is that it's high damage rate. You should not be able to one shot a player that is wearing kevlar but not with a rifle. I understand that it is a ""shotgun pistol"" as such but I believe it throws the balance of the game off. One example of this is that if you hop into any competitive game (aside from the stupid new pause feature which really has no use due to a random game of comp not being in a tournament or league) there is no economy strategy anymore. CS:GO is a tactical shooter, teambased also, but due to the R8 being too OP, teams are now choosing to force buy R8, Kevlar whenever possible. It makes the game less tense and enjoyable when you know every round you can be out gunned out of your hands even if you are 10 rounds up and they have no money.

✘𝒂𝑅𝒐c𝒂,True,"Counter-Strike is Counter-Strike, between old and current versions, CS always sought the balance between gameplay, performance and visibility. With constant upgrades, always improving a gameplay and a visual version of the game, a valve is pushing itself to the maximum to this, and the result could not be different, one of the most popular and played games in the world! After all it is also a game that runs on any machine! This, Global Offensive, is proof that you do not have to release one version every year, but on the contrary, make it look like old versions with new features and technology that only Valve knows. If you have played a Counter-Strike before, it has a significant improvement in graphics, a well-crafted competitive mode where you play with players who are patent-pending and clear to fully customized servers per community."

'WitteBae 🌹,True,"Counter-Strike makes you work to enjoy the content, and you'll have to put many hours of play into it before enjoying the feeling of conquering it. Weapons are a huge part of the series too, with CS:GO not an exception. Each round provides a cash sum based on your previous performance, and with this you can purchase armour, projectiles and weapons. Firearms range from standard assault rifles to shotguns and sniper rifles, and you'll want to experiment with each one to see which works best. What makes Counter-Strike such a popular series - and what will no doubt make CS:GO the next big PC shooter - is the thrill of the ego chase. As you die, often continuously, the frustration is outweighed by an aspiration to do better. In a game where success is pinned on attention to detail, death often triggers an internal failure analysis that the player will mull over while waiting for a new session to load. It becomes a spiral of egging yourself on to do better - and if you become a good player, the game becomes a stage for you to parade your skills. Global Offensive builds on the CS series by going through a significant checklist presented by its community and marking off as many points as possible. Gun game as its own separate mode? Check. Competitive capabilities built in? Check! Map balancing here and there? Check, check, check. As a result, there are numerous upgrades that will adjust gameplay while also making accessibility far better. The wide range of grenades, for example, will likely make play more tactical - laying down incendiary grenades will thwart rushes, while decoys, which fake gunfire and fool radar points, are brilliant tools for messing with the minds of established players. The actual core shooting will be a huge talking point for many months to come. It has been tinkered slightly and gives weapons a noticeably floaty feel, which doesn't sit well to begin with. We eventually found ourselves enamoured by it, and the impact of hits add a real tactile distinction to play. It's what doesn't work, however, that is most notable. Regular mode has no new maps added to it, while all the new guns seem somewhat cosmetic. Global Offensive has also removed some of its middling weapons such as the MP5, essentially pushing even more players to stick with the AK and the M4. Sometimes it gives the impression that there is in fact less valuable content than in previous CS releases. If one assumed this was Counter-Strike Source with a visual mod installed, there would often be little to shake that impression. There's also now a split between casual and competitive servers - however, many players aren't yet aware of the differences, mainly because the distinction isn't made obvious enough. It becomes even more confusing if you join a community server with all hosts of mods installed on it, which have perhaps taken casual mode, turned friendly fire on and essentially made it as close to Source as possible. At times, arranging games in Competitive Mode feels like a chore. Joining a five-on-five war is simple enough, but attempt to lobby up with a group of friends and join a game, and you'll often hit a snag. Myself and a few others tried to find a competitive game with no luck, simply being told that no servers were currently available. When you finally do join, it works fine, but the wait and work required to find a game seems like a drawback. We eventually gave up and resorted to using IRC to find matches, as we would with Source. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is not the key evolution point that we were hoping for, and the response from the community often reflects this view. On many occasions, other players used phrases such as ""same old"" to us. This is elementally Counter-Strike Source with some fine-tuning under the bonnet, and Valve appears to have acknowledged this with the reasonable RRP attached to it. And yet the core DNA of the game has not lost its appeal. This is still a glorious experience that sets a benchmark for all multiplayer shooters. Valve's objective with Global Offensive was to draw together the active communities of both the Source and trusty 1.6 edition. It clearly has a good chance."

Y_No_Luv,True,"Hello and welcome, new player.  Allow me to reveal some of the likely outcomes of you purchasing this game: The 'Cannon Fodder' (40% of all players) - Never really good enough to make it past Nova 3, constantly flaming, talking sh it, changing their names and pictures to things increasingly racist, blaming hackers, smurfs, lag and weapon choice of oponents for just what is a mixture of adderall exhausted reflexes and having a shi tty gaming rig from 2002, frame dropping on source games.  Can be easily identified by it's trademark defence mechanism, when being called out for being bad the Cannon Fodder will attempt to convince it's team it has been 'Trolling' all along. Habitat: Dust2 The 'Enthusiasts' (30% of all players) - A wide range of Skillsets from Nova Master to around Legendary Eagle, these players can perform consistantly and at least show a basic level of human decency,  most of them will give an unenthusastic hand job for $2.49USD because they feel they are 'due for a knife' or because 'my friend told me he had a feeling' Will one day be doing unspreakable things for a japenese businessman on a glass coffee table to pay off gambling debts that can be traced directly back to a greedy cu nt and his case racket. Habitat: Dust2, Nuke, Mirage, Cache The 'C unts' (15% of all players) - A curious breed, come in two distinct flavours 'Hacker' and i mean legit hacker, not hacker because he saw your shadow in bedroom on dust2 and prefired you, you fuc king mook, These are players who either used to or almost fit into the 'Enthusiast Category' and were turned into soulless, spineless dic kbags who cannot win on skill or merit. The other flavour, less cancerous but just as annoying 'Smurfs' people who play at levels far beneath there skill to boost their friends, ruin other peoples day for the joy of being a cu nt or to boost their dwindling ego that is one Sylvia Plath poem away from a stomach full of painkillers in the bathtub. Habitat: Dust2, Nuke, Mirage, Cache, Train, Overpass, Inferno, Cobblestone, Office, Assault, Any Operation Maps The 'Pros' (15% of all players) - Professional Esports player OR someone who has played enough CS (usually in excess of 2500 hours - 16 weeks to us humans) to get to a level where they know every smoke, every flash, every angle, every strat on every map and to you i say kudos, kudos on mastering a video game to the point you know it as well as your mothers disappointed face when she looks at you knowing that while normal people are studying, working or contributing to society in someway, you were hunched over your keyboard for the 7th straight hour of the day, mouth breathing in pleasure as that voice says 'Counter Terrorists Win' Habitat: Mothers basement 11/10 would play again."

souzones,True,"As a long time Counter-Strike player, I couldn't just let   just slip by without playing it. As I always followed the evolution of the franchise, I did the same to the game and noticed some improvements as well as things that got worse. Let's start talking about how happy I was when I found out that Valve is now paying great attention to the competitive community of the franchise. Before GO, you only had two options: host a server or play on a rented server you knew. There wasn't a ""quick game"" option like there is now, turning games much easier to be arranged. And it also works for competitive playing, as there is a whole new competitive mode which players may join to play like they were playing an official match, with official rules applied and no need of typing specific comands on the console as the game does everything for you automatically. Another thing I really appreciated is the guns market stablished for the game, shaking really good the community's market. I bought some games on Steam using only the money earned from selling some of those guns. Another good thing is that Valve also officialized fan game modes like Gungame. However, the game hasn't changed much in relation to   when it comes to gameplay physics or even graphics and sounds. Some people even call GO ""CS: Source with skins"". And there have been some worsenings related to the guns, like the fact that some useless guns have been added to the game (the new shotgun and PP-19 Bizon are some examples) and others have been ""nerfed"" (yes, M4A1 and Desert Eagle, I'm looking at you). In the end,   won't let you down if you're looking for a very nice first-person shooting game with an immense community to play with. If you like the   franchise, you'll probably fall in love with this game. Still not a 10, but we're getting there."
QuantizedAnson,True,"The physics makes newbies able to catch kills when you start playing. Modes are quite balanced and fun to play. Variaty of Weapons are enough for players to find their playing style. It brings back precious memories of our CS1.6. The Skin awards becomes a motive for players who's not willing to buy skins from market, to play more. I would give it 8/10 at overall."

However, I'm just a lucky silver 2 with swag-7 and pro90. I tried my best to give him the Christmas present, but I failed. So sad. ------------------------------------------ Update something about racism. Well....as an Asian, I encountered lots of racism assaults during the gameplay.  I would just simply mute the racist and report him after the match, cuz I play this game for fun and practicing English, not arguing with other players... Fortunately, most people are friendly and are willing to learn new things about Asia. Don't regard all the jokes as racism. I also made some friends online, people from East Europe, State people and Canadians. Hope the world can develop in peace and go hell terrorism! Yes, that refers to you, ISIS. Go hell. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Prefer it to Rising Storm, because it has a crosshair. Prefer it to Tomb Raider, because I don't have to aim by holding R-mouse. Prefer it to Call of Duty, because I would know how I died. Playing CS:GO is a good way to practice English.

Shant_X,True,"Ahh... CSGO, i know i know what u think when csgo pop ups <HACKERS>, yeah i hate them too, and yeah it is to be known that csgo has one of the most toxic gaming communities and now the player numbers are reducing too, lot of reasons like (fortnite) i did not say that name. But u know what, we have to become a better version of ourselves and don't blame valve for everything i know that they are not trying very hard but u know u and us together we can grow this community more. If u know ur friend is hacker UN-friend him off-course its your choice to do so and yeah reporting works too. And if u r a HACKER AND READING THIS then man!!! go and hack pubg and fortnite bruh!! those games are kind of open world and 99 people to kill im sure you'll have more fun or just play vice city type panzer and go berserk. So, as to increase the community, please guys don't be toxic, if you play well do not think that everyone will play like you. People have problems like PC, internet or equipment issues. And yeah if you are determined to win then go to competitive MM with known people, create a team, i know it isn't easy but you'll find people. But please in case u want only to have fun or only to win then for god's sake don't play solo queue and ruin other people experience. If you r solo queuing than try to adapt to the team. And as a solo queue person you should be able to do it. And most important don't get angry on new people just try to give them directions not everyone who play csgo want to go pro most of the community people want to have a good time with friends and win. And about recommending the game, I highly recommend it. And, if anyone from valve reading this please remove the 7-day trading ban, make it 2-day. Keep hitting the M1 Gamerzzzzzzz, i'll be back with another review. -Shant_X out"

🌟 taipaN-[CE] 🌟,True,"When I reviewed Counter-Strike Source a few years ago, I called it things like ""immortal"" and ""the definitive multiplayer FPS."" The Awp is easily one of the most satisfying weapons in gaming. Quickscoping and noscoping can be a gamble - I really like the balance and precise feel of the Awp.  The rest of the weapons feel really good - there is much more variety here: we are talking custom weapon skins and even a custom loadout for each team.  This is one of the areas where CS:GO shines, and leaves its predecessors in the dark ages. Competitive matchmaking is one of the really nice features of Global Offensive.  The game allows you to play in competitive matches based on your skill level rating. This is done similar to the matchmaking in Dota 2.  While not perfect, I find the matchmaking to be pretty accurate - it is rarely a cakewalk. Always be wary of the player community for this game - this community has some sick and twisted people, tons of trolls, smack talkers, hack accusers, mic spammers, and cry babies, lol.  Fortunately you can mute players, and if you are so inclined, can vote them off the game - nice! Trading and items drops are a fairly big part of the game as well. One of the neat things about the game is you can easily sell back your in game drops via Steam market and basically play this game for free or even profit from it. its insane, but some items sell for legitimate currency. CS:GO is on the rise reaching peaks near 500,000 players.  There are huge tournaments played, and with each passing month the game sees positive growth.  I think its safe to say this is the new ""definitive multiplayer FPS""! 9/10"

Commander Stealth,False,"Okay Valve. I spent $20 dollars on this game only for it to go free just a year later? I want my money back. I was really annoyed at the time this review was written, so pardon my redundant vocabulary throughout this review. Comparable to other greedy f**knuggets in the gaming industry, today, Valve has set the bar up there with EA and Bethesda. You know what Valve, instead of using all that money and resources you got sitting over there to give us, your customers, our long awaited sequels we've respectfully requested since 2004. Example: Half Life 3, Left 4 Dead 3, Portal 3 etc. You @$$holes think your next best move is to create a battle royale mode for a $20 dollar game you released 6 years ago, that has randomized loot box Activision/EA microtransactions? Hey here's an idea, Valve: How about you lazy f**ks start tending to the rampant issue of hackers in this effing game. By making this game free, you open a large window for hackers and other cheaters; they've invaded Counter-Strike faster than the Germans invaded Poland. Cheaters are just showing up in Prime Matchmaking; what the hell's the point of even paying $15 dollars for the Prime Status Upgrade? What the hell is this, Valve? As a matter of fact, I stopped playing this game last year because of this problem. Why make Counter-Strike: Global Offensive free? Ah, so you can attempt to hook and entice people to purchase your stupid $2.50 one time use keys for your BS randomized loot boxes to maximize profit. Your intentions, your methods have not changed at all. The one time you want to create content other than cosmetic skins to sell separately, you decide to jump on the popular battle royal train to maximize profit. I mean, really? A battle royale mode for Counter-Strike? Doesn't that seem a little strange and unnecessary for a game like this? What, are we gonna see a battle royale mode in Rainbow Six next month?  Like I stated earlier, there are infinitely better and creative things you can make with all those resources. As if you haven't got enough money from hosting tournaments, video game sales and loot box sales, you need more money? What are you trying to prove with this? The fact that you even thought this was a good idea proves your intentions, this showcases your true nature batter than anything else. You don't give a damn about the customers, the players, the fans, you don't give a f**k.  You care about money, and that's it. There's more important things in life, Valve. You can make money without being a piece of sh%t. I can't support Valve anymore. I can't do it. This is the end of my respect for this company, who once represented the best for PC gamers. People are gonna look back at this and approach Valve with caution. I am done with you, Valve. After Dying Light 2 is released, I'll be looking for another source to purchase my video games from. This really does suck. The gaming industry has done a great job at gradually pushing me away from it with their sickening lack of respect for their audience, as I have watched over the last decade how game series I used to adore have been ripped apart for the sake of loot box supply drop microtransaction systems, and Counter-Strike is no different. So all of that is literally every major aspect of the game and I enjoy none of it for the reasons I just stated. Oh yeah and all of you writing positive reviews for this game today are effing morons.

Low ranks are a bottomless pit with no escape unless you get a whole new account due to smurfs, trolls, hackers and people who are idiots.

I bought the game for that. Nope! You have to play 5 hours of casual. During which, people micspam racist music and other things, act toxic, insult, etc. After that- Things will get better, right?  Nope! Low rank matches have hackers upon hackers, smurfs upon smurfs, and you get loss after loss as you're trying to learn the game. Why would Valve increase the price of their game or IP ban hackers? The hackers buy the game for $15 again and again, to troll 2 to 4 matches, then get banned, and repeat. And repeat. So why would they stop if it makes them money? I would much prefer to spend $60 on a game I know works than $15 on a game that is nothing but aids and racial slurs. Once you win 10 comp. matches, things get better, right? Nopity Nope! You get banned for a full 24 hours FOR WINNING. You have to sit there AND WAIT and can't play comp again! Add a new paypal account? Great- you can't trade items for 6 days! Just got the game? Great! You can't sell or buy items for a full month! Everything about this game treats new players like they're cheaters/hackers/smurfs/trolls, while allowing experienced players to do those things with little effort. Very steep learning curve that is not helped in most ways, very toxic community, very fustrating game mechanics, server performance getting worse every day- rubber banding at 65 ping, if you have more than 250ms ping you teleport all over the map and can do nothing at all, and on top of it all- you get banned just for WINNING.

As a matter of fact, I stopped playing this game last year because of this problem. Why make Counter-Strike: Global Offensive free? Ah, so you can attempt to hook and entice people to purchase your stupid $2.50 one time use keys for your BS randomized loot boxes to maximize profit. Your intentions, your methods have not changed at all. The one time you want to create content other than cosmetic skins to sell separately, you decide to jump on the popular battle royal train to maximize profit. I mean, really? A battle royale mode for Counter-Strike? Doesn't that seem a little strange and unnecessary for a game like this? What, are we gonna see a battle royale mode in Rainbow Six next month?  Like I stated earlier, there are infinitely better and creative things you can make with all those resources. As if you haven't got enough money from hosting tournaments, video game sales and loot box sales, you need more money? What are you trying to prove with this? The fact that you even thought this was a good idea proves your intentions, this showcases your true nature batter than anything else. You don't give a damn about the customers, the players, the fans, you don't give a f**k.  You care about money, and that's it. There's more important things in life, Valve. You can make money without being a piece of sh%t. I can't support Valve anymore. I can't do it. This is the end of my respect for this company, who once represented the best for PC gamers. People are gonna look back at this and approach Valve with caution. I am done with you, Valve. After Dying Light 2 is released, I'll be looking for another source to purchase my video games from. This really does suck. The gaming industry has done a great job at gradually pushing me away from it with their sickening lack of respect for their audience, as I have watched over the last decade how game series I used to adore have been ripped apart for the sake of loot box supply drop microtransaction systems, and Counter-Strike is no different. So all of that is literally every major aspect of the game and I enjoy none of it for the reasons I just stated. Oh yeah and all of you writing positive reviews for this game today are effing morons. But tell me what you think. Am I overreacting? Or is what I say pretty spot on? Tell me your thoughts and opinions in the comments below."
Glover,False,Free csgo more cheaters in game....
Emperor of Byzantium,False,no. I'm done
Fuckbeak,False,"Boy oh boy is this ****** cancer! Very unfriendly to new players. Low ranks are a bottomless pit with no escape unless you get a whole new account due to smurfs, trolls, hackers and people who are idiots. Loss after loss forever, versus 5 cued smurfs on the other team or hackers. So you would think, after spending CASH on this game, that I would be able to play with my friends, right? I bought the game for that. Nope! You have to play 5 hours of casual. During which, people micspam racist music and other things, act toxic, insult, etc. After that- Things will get better, right?  Nope! Low rank matches have hackers upon hackers, smurfs upon smurfs, and you get loss after loss as you're trying to learn the game. Why would Valve increase the price of their game or IP ban hackers? The hackers buy the game for $15 again and again, to troll 2 to 4 matches, then get banned, and repeat. And repeat. So why would they stop if it makes them money? I would much prefer to spend $60 on a game I know works than $15 on a game that is nothing but aids and racial slurs. Once you win 10 comp. matches, things get better, right? Nopity Nope! You get banned for a full 24 hours FOR WINNING. You have to sit there AND WAIT and can't play comp again! Add a new paypal account? Great- you can't trade items for 6 days! Just got the game? Great! You can't sell or buy items for a full month! Everything about this game treats new players like they're cheaters/hackers/smurfs/trolls, while allowing experienced players to do those things with little effort. Very steep learning curve that is not helped in most ways, very toxic community, very fustrating game mechanics, server performance getting worse every day- rubber banding at 65 ping, if you have more than 250ms ping you teleport all over the map and can do nothing at all, and on top of it all- you get banned just for WINNING. As well as abandoning. Would not recommend stay away, you have been warned."

Mark_RPG,False,"I'll go in depth as to why my reasoning is what it is: The ""matchmaking"" is non-existant, I've played a fair few games of competitive, yet rarely do they seem balanced or fair, as a player with little under 100 hours, I get pitched against players with 300/400 hours, how can Valve call this sorry excuse of a matchmaking system good? I find it appauling that they could even consider saying this game even contains matchmaking. Another large problem is hackers, they seem to slip past Valve with little to no problems, either Valve don't care, or have given up trying to prevent them. Overall, a 5/10, as the game itself isn't the problem, it's Valve's end that's letting it down largely."

YouTube Singer-Pls Subscribe <3,True,"I'm Gold Nova Master now and still Investigator(to become one Win 150 Competitive matches, reach GN1 and be good) in Overwatch. We.... 1. now have new modes in game like wingman and flying scoutman. 2. had Hydra Operation modes like Zip-Zap (knife-zeus only) and Heavy Armor too. wish they keeped Zip-Zap.  3. had Hydra Guardian Campaign which was so fun. i liked it. 4. now have new Dust ll map which i like too. many spots for camping now. 5. still have improvements and new content in a game released in 2012. OMG. 6. still have the useless XP for Overwatch. no increase yet. 7. have the new trust system which effectively stops placing griefers/bots in your team (so no need to wait for ppl in lobbies) but increases the risk of facing cheaters and SMURFS in matches alot comparing to prime matchmaking. if they combine it with prime which effectively lowers the amount of cheaters and smurfs u might face, then that can be great. i'm still using prime. 8. still have smurfing problem. matches are not balanced. 9. still see mad ""Russians"". voice disabled. I still recommend this game. 9/10 Deleted the game cuz of griefers (derank wanting smurfs or simply trollers) that ruined my every match. u might suggest me to play with a team of my friends...its nice in theory, but hey i have over 30 active csgo friends and still when i wanna play i cant find 5 in-game and not in the middle of a match or afk. u might say ""ok wait for their match to end"". there are problems here: 1.i dont wanna wait for atleast 20mins to start my match. 2.even if i wait, i cant convince that one person who is already in lobby to wait. 3.imagine we wait and he comes after 20mins. the other friend who was already in lobby goes afk now and doesnt hit accept button... 4.imagine he comes, my friend is also ready but hey were just 3 and we need 2 other ppl. so we wait for another ppl to come...after some time we find 2 other ppl and guess what? WE JOIN THE MATCH! YES!!! but...theres a cheater in there or the match is extremely unbalanced as a result of smurfs. so..they wont play with me forever! find some other guys again choke! LOOP!  Alright im an Investigator now in this Overwatch thing. so far, ive seen many ppl using switch scripts(awp2knife2awp), obvious aimbots(makes u vertigo if u keep watching their demo because of the rotating screen), obvious wallhacks(they dont even wait for their enemy to show up like pro wallhackers and kill them from behind walls after waiting for a second :D), on/off aimbots/aimlocks(they use this technique mostly when theyre loosing hard to comeback(the score is 1-8 for example till when its 5-8 and their team have autos), on/off wallhacks(which are REALLY hard to spot as they use it just to know who is where and for close distances they use footsteps sound) and also griefers that ruin the entire match for their team.  so whats my opinion now about my past negative review? well...nothing has changed to me. reason? EXTREMELY unbalanced matches. i first thought they are cheaters that they play well like that, but after specing a few after the matches, i found out that they didnt cheat and i can say confidently now that.....thats all about balance problem matches have. maybe, my teammates in the match were ""boosted newbies"" most of the time or maybe it's smurfing problem.... its clearly not Valve's fault. keeping the community of a game released in 2012 clean is almost impossible. but to me, Valve has done whatever it could. thats exactly why im recommending the game now.  1.Smurfs: if in other team, they are boosting someone they've got money from OR if in my team, they wanna lose so they can derank to silver l and start smurfing again....so in both sides u will looe the match anyway. 2.Cheaters: mostly wallhackers or on/off aimbotters. 3.Very! unbalanced matches as a result of high smurfs count. 4.Alot of rude kids, toxic players (=players that start abusing/blocking when u fail a 1vs1 or votekick u every round or hit/block u on purpose when they think u play bad). ofc u should have the confidence of Barrack Obama to be able to deal with em. 5.Griefers who are usually derank-wanting smurfs. (for definition of griefing search wikipedia) 6.If u get kicked many times u will be banned for some time. really?!?!! About reporting....all reports u do,   but after u lose the match and u won't get back points u lost when a cheater is banned. rather than that if u play in a random team containing a cheater even once(which is not your fault) after some time when he gets banned, u will looe your rank and xp ALOT. and he....he makes a new account and plays again happily :D Anyway, im still addicted to this thing and i cant really stop playing it. dont really know why..... As i got more far from cs1.6 and when went to play other games, a strong passion to multiplayer fps made me come back to this game. anyway...its a great fps game to me, not a pure cs ofc but most similar game to it in the market. rather than explaining the quality of fps thing about this game in detail, i wanna talk about the multiplayer side. its AWESOME! why? its clear. it has a   that bans ppl who leave a match, kick others so many times, get kicked so many times, attack a teammate twice in beginning of each round, kill 3 teammates in 30 rounds, kill teammate at round start, and man u know whats great about this cooldown system? imagine u get a 30min cooldown. from when that ban ends till 7 days if u get another cooldown for whatever reason it would be 24 hours. and again if u get a cooldown sooner than 7 days after ban ends, that would be 7 days! and so on.... also,  . after starting to seriously play for a month (my previous play time was 20 hours without any competitive matches played) ive been thanked 4 times for reporting cheaters. game has   who watch a random demo of the players that were reported so many times in longterm or alot less but frequently in short time, and if most of them find the suspect guilty that means a 1 month(griefing) or permanent ban. so, if someone  , if abuses other ppl using mic or text (or also if someone is a ""kid""), just block him when in match and report him and ask others to report him too. dont report him just once...do it many times. well....im an honest person....so to be honest...the problem is that....any cheater/abuser/griefer (including smurf) who gets banned from playing in official servers can rebuy the game again as its cheap. but when they make a new account they have to rank it up to 3 and then they can't win more than 2 competitive matches in a day until they win 10. so their comeback will be delayed. but theres a better way to avoid cheaters/smurfs:   the solution to that problem is simple. play competitive matches from wednesday when weekly xp boost is available and play until u reach ""reduced earned xp"" each week and u will get to lvl 21 fast. then, get a prime account. it effectively reduces cheaters and smurfs in matches u play. all being said, this game is still ALIVE cuz Valve still supports the game rather than making a new version of it. plus that u wont lose a thing if u spend time boosting your skills in this game as its not gonna die. definitely 10/10."

BKBN20,False,★☆☆☆☆ 3 outta 6 of my last games had cheaters in them. Nice! (1 star for chickens)
c0nc,False,"First of all, I have a large body of hours on this game. I've seen multiple game breaking updates, e.g. initial implementation of the CZ-75, Revolver, (at the time) massive change to game sounds, slowing down awp scope speed, super fast crouching scout running and many more. However, a lot of issues exist, which valve refuse to acknowledge as issues, e.g. no perfect first bullet accuracy (hearthstone RNG), one way smokes, the terrible UI when watching demos, how every update ensures my 1080ti and i7-7700k can barely run CS:GO at 250fps, the volume of hackers on the game, peekers advantage, hit reg, inconsistencies in the game's playability between resolutions, re-doing maps and not testing how well they run, making people with lower end rigs drop below 50fps, molotov's random spreading, pistol damage and mobility, and gosh I could go on forever. But to be fair there has been multiple positive updates: Getting rid of the fire car on dust 2 long. That's all I can think about at this moment. But I'm sure there's more. However, I have to play this game: 1. because I have skins that are worth more than my petty existance,  2. There's something addicting about being british and joining a game and speaking with an accent, 3. On the occasional games that teams are balanced and there's no cheaters, they have been known to be fun (I swear), 4. Every other shooter is just boring cos of the huge player base on counter-strike, 5. I have invested so many hours in this game, I just don't know what to do anymore."

SniperFameOne,False,"And so, I had played this game for like 3-4 years, had 2k + hours on it, and with my experience in this game, All I gotta say about is :  1) Stupidly ""special"" gameplay needed, that differs from other games! Even if they claim to have ""fixed"" the whole HitBox system, is still s**t! I still was shooting people, seeing blood coming out, even heard the Headshot sound, but no reg. Funny thing right? Happens... (it should not) 2) One of the Worst anti-Cheat system (VAC) that even a 14 years old kid, with a really small knowledge of programming can get through that by-pass. Funny thing when they released this whole ""Overwatch"" thing, when you are LEM with 2k+ hours, and there's a Gold Nova 2 with 350+ hours to judge your gameplay if you're hacking or not! 3) Really bad gaming community including 12 y.o. kids from Different countries , having 0 knowledge of English. Same happened with older players. Toxic players are no. 2 problem, but I gotta admit, people are Not as toxic as the League of Legends' ones...  4) Really bad servers, with the whole valve giving 0 f***s about it. (64 ticks while Every damn other Community server has 128) 5) Absolutely bad Game Support (you can't even e-mail them, you have to search deep to find an address to contact them) 6) SMURFS. I had played some Smurfs games on it, pretty easy and stuff, but NO worth... as I had my♥♥♥♥♥kicked from Supremes and Globals, and I was pretty mad about it, I stopped doing that! Many people just wanna show off their skill to Low rank people, are something more than Pathetic! unless you're a Youtuber and you wanna make some Funtages out of it, there's No reason to do it! And yeah, if you're a new player expect a LOT , but a LOOOOT of these f**kers around.  7) Game un-balance. Cheaper guns are way better than Expensive ones! 2.700$ 1-shot kill and 3.100$ 2-shot kill in the Head! Not to mention 500$ Tec-9 at close range! As much as the Prices are so close to Realism, gameplay is NOT!  I can say that I used to have fun games 2 years ago, made a lot of friends from this game, bad as the time goes by, this game is dying and Valve is responsible for this! If a whole game company doesn't care for a game they made, that is the Most populated they ever made, then there's no reason to keep playing it!   If you're a new player , or even if you're thinking of getting this game, DON'T DO IT! Get some more money, and spend them on other games, or even Free2Play games that are actually WAY better than this... Or even just buy yourself a good MacDonalds meal. It gives you Less cancer than this game."

What I'm saying is that this game was worth buying BUT now its not even worth to install... unless you going to hack too, so I don't even know why you reading this insted of ruining the fun for others right now"
ЯΞΔĻÍŦψ,False,"The game is a money pit filled with hackers.  The rank system is a joke. Overwatch is a joke. VAC is a joke. There is no anti-cheat system for this game. It has a tired engine. (2004) Source engine It's a game based off a skill game. Just when you master a skill or skills they just throw in another broke update  and break more crap like changing the whole gun skill set (joke) Adding the R8, A gun never in any Counter Strike, Is maybe all you need to know about the brain trust behind the game anymore. Best idea ever !  (Not) I know lets add Flintlocks,Muzzleloaders,Catapult and Slingshots. They will claim to fix things like broke spawns (Dust DM spawn) still broke ! DM (Deathmatch) has the Worst spawns of any game i have ever seen. After one of the great updates you will have to play through weeks of people who have pings from another planet. Random lag spikes or micro stutters, do to it's not optimized well. Could it be a good game ? yes ! If they had someone who had a brain and played it and then fixed it and left it alone   other then adding the money making garbage (I know you only care if it's a cash cow). Legit players suffer while hackers roam free. (I know you don't care cause you make more money) not banning people   hence people having so many accounts... I have 1 account and proud of it. I know people will hate on me and I don't care it's the truth....... By the way i'd spend more money through Steam but after seeing what this game has turned out to be and the stupid taxes crap from selling the junk I get from game (not real money by the way, The real money has already been taxed) and the lack of caring about hackers.    "" I'll just save it"". If your a legit player wanting to learn the game and enjoy the game you will be disappointed and penalized. If you a hacker or a scammer you will love this game and be rewarded..... If you look at most of the positive reviews they are from people who have close to no hours played. If you look at the negative reviews they are from people who put a lot of time into the game. (1/7/15 update)  They added gloves to CSGO... Must have been why everyone was deranking, The old ones wore out.... Can't wait for Stat Trak Clown shoes...! Once again another update this time destroying the most played map in CS. Nuke was bad enough. Old Nuke was great. New Nuke sux. Old Dust 2 great. New Dust 2 sux. You want to fix something fix the anti-cheat I mean put an anti-cheat so the game can be enjoyed. For all the noobs that cry that I have so many hours. I've played since beta so that would be before the release August 21, 2012. The game now, Is not the game it used to be. Started going down hill once they added skins, Not for Steam but for players. If it was still good I'd have many more hours then I do. And yes I still play a little when my real good friend asks me too. Other then that I dont touch it anymore....... As soon as my friend is done playing CSGO I'll uninstall....! ""I never leave a friend or a man behind"" (In other words I don't bail on my friends) After reading a lot of the reviews I found that so many of them are negative with the thumbs up icon. So it ends up this game receives more positive reviews then it should. If this game was left alone, With a fixed rank system ""Except for the mostly ulgy skins they add for more money""  people who really cared about learning and playing like a team the way was ment to be played ! This game would be great........  There is a Mute/Block for thoses who don't want to know how many times your mom has had sex with a 12 yr old.  But 90% of everyone you face has brand new account and has the reflexes of god and X-Ray vision of Superman. No one gets banned. Hackers will say ""I heard you"" or it's ""my smurf"". In any case if your Global and on another account and play as a global on a nova account then your a cheater and a scumbag. The Facts and nothing but the facts........!                                              Oh did i mention the game is a joke ! Changing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive's name to ""Hackfest Simulator"""

NekoSandwich,False,"FFS, its free now?! Wtf Valve. i waste money just for you to make it free? and you pander to the battle royale comunity? Dumb as hell"
Arctiks,False,"First of all I would like to say that I love all of the counter-strike games (CS:GO, CSS and CS 1.6) as they have all been a huge part of my childhood but not everything is fine and dandy and I will address some of these issues in my review. First of all, competitive matchmaking is going to be hell if you are a new player. You will not be able to take part in prime matchmaking and will therefore be forced to grind out the game until you reach rank level 21 (the level required to get prime). This won't be fun however as you will encounter either a hacker or a smurf in every other game as you climb your way up to level 21. This will not only ruin the game for you but will also annoy/frustrate the rest of the players on your team leading to an increase in toxicity down coms. Furthermore, I feel as if Valve no longer cares about CS:GO and treats it more like a money making machine than a video game. I came to this conclusion as Valve seems to be constantly releasing new cases (a form of gambling for kids) instead of releasing updates to fix the prominent issues which loyal players face on a day-to-day basis such as the terrible anti-cheat, the tickrate, the hitboxes, the shot registration and the list goes on.... Recently, someone left this comment on my review, his/her name was Choinka: Screenshot of the comment:  Comment:  'Cant unsee the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ review. Came to get a sticker pack but had to respond. Valve is working on a new anti cheat and majority of good anti cheats have access to all files in your computer, which is essentially spying. Do you really think a massive company like Valve will utilise such techniques to ban a few cheaters? And even then, the best of the best are undetectable everywhere, even on ESEA. Cheats is a serious big industry. Why don't you apply to Valve and make them a better anti cheat that will surely ban everyone. You talk about the level requirement for prime for new players. A new player should not queue for competitive before even reaching level 21. These scrubs don't have any idea how to play the game and end up dropping the bomb or killing their teammates. The hitboxes aren't even that bad, people in games like overwatch seem to not care at all, where the hitboxes are much much worse. Hit reg isn't bad either. You're just looking for excuses to hate on CS.' My Response:  1) 'Valve is working on a new anti cheat': show me where you found/got this information 2) 'Cheats is a serious big industry': I agree that counter-strike will never be completely free of hackers but the anti-cheat is honestly terrible and it is ridiculous at how many people get away with hacking when they are so blatant. An example that I can give is the overwatch system which leads to a game ban if the player/account is convicted from the demo. For someone to be an overwatch candidate (The Suspect), their account has to receive 11 reports in one day. This basically means that people are able to blatantly 'rage hack' in two games each day if they are playing in a 5 man as they do not fall into the overwatch pool. This is a terrible system and valve already knows as it has been pointed out to them so many times in the past and yet they have still done nothing about it. 3) 'And even then, the best of the best are undetectable everywhere, even on ESEA': I know this already but you are talking about the 'best of the best' which most people won't and don't have access to. I have been playing ESEA for a while now and my point remains valid. I have only ever encountered 3 cheaters on ESEA which I reported immediately and as expected all 3 of them were banned in the following days. (THIS IS FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE) 4) 'A new player should not queue for competitive before even reaching level 21': What sort of point is that? I'm pretty sure you queued a game of comp before reaching 100 hours in-game? xD. Furthermore, there is a competitive rank that is catered towards new players, its called silver.... 5) 'hitboxes aren't even that bad, people in games like overwatch seem to not care at all, where the hitboxes are much much worse. Hit reg isn't bad either.' I also play overwatch and I agree that people don't really give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the hit reg, but overwatch is not CS:GO and CS:GO is not overwatch. In overwatch the terrible hitboxes have much less of an impact on winning/losing the game than in CS:GO where one shot could determine the outcome of a round which in turn could determine the outcome of the entire game. An example of this is allu's shot on short (dust 2) which missed when it should have hit and ended up with NiP losing the game. Furthermore, if you want more examples of the same thing, take a look at the thousands of videos on youtube which demonstrate how terrible the hitboxes/hitreg is (A huge part to do with all this is the 64 tick servers).   6) 'You're just looking for excuses to hate on CS.' That is not true at all, this following quote was taken straight out of my review: 'I would like to say that I love all of the counter-strike games (CS:GO, CSS and CS 1.6) as they have all been a huge part of my childhood'. I am not looking for excuses to hate on CS as I love the game but am instead picking out and addressing the issues which I face whenever I play the game.  Regards, Arctik."
Bread Man,False,- hitboxes lvl 9000 - awesome community - great russian players - teammates without mic or with mic worth of 5 cents
shevijs <3 S1mbaa,False,"Its been 3 years sinc Im playing this game and following pro scene very closly. I guess, its time for a very short review. Heads up to the community for making Counter Strike as one of the biggest e-sports titles again. But if anything else - this game is pretty big pile of crap. IIRC, its march 2014, sinc development of this game is going only downhill trajectory (CZ-75 update it is). Not only swallowing up updetes has been painful, but also watching how problems arent adressed for yeras. But when volvo try to take care of issue, you can be shure that it will be one step in the right direction and atleast 3 steps backwards (ladders and hitboxes, sound, etc.). Eventually picture makes sense - brain cell non existence of humanity has been taken to whole new level.  In the end there was only one ingredient that was necesasry. Despite about feeling that this game is more like skin simulator with jackpots and betting sites within past year or so, volvo did two things right - skins and micropayments. Without necessary evil Counter Strike would be alive in 2016? Not so sure.  Nonethless about game itself, its been amazing years together with pro scene, lets hope that one day this game will become a truly great e-sports title and in 2016 it will not be destroyed by someones greed and careless, because with todays features this game have potential atleast to be as good as Counter Strike 1.6 still is."

deathyy,True,"Counter Strike: Global Offensive, the remake of the classic CS games and not to our surprise, the devs did a good job. One of the lovely things about it, that of had not been kept I seriously doubt the game would be as popular as it is currently, it keeps the mechanics from the classic CS and CS:S and adds a few of it's own, that the original CS and CS:S games could have done with. CS’s weak point was always the graphics, the original games were based of the HL1 engine, which I am sure all you are aware is reasonably old, although it’s added a new range of updated maps, including two operations. The most recent being Operation Bravo in which a number of maps were added to the game as DLC. And once again, Valve have decided to take the generous approach to this, an example is that if the lobby leader has the Operation Bravo pass, and no one else does, everyone can play Op. Bravo, good job Valve, you did it again. What was missing/wrong with this game has been fixed by Valve, which is fantastic. Items have been added, you can have gun camos which is an nifty feature, although many think it's turning into TF2, which is a valid point, but Valve need there money, if you take a look at the price of the game, it’s not exactly the same as COD (ew) which has a hefty price tag of £40 ($60 I think) and CSGO managed to do fine at £12, which I think is $15 in the US. Sadly I did not play the original CS, I have however obviously seen gameplay, and watched friends play it. I have played a small amount of CS:S and compared it to CSGO, which was considerably easy, some of the main differences are simply that the problems that those games have/had have been completely eradicated from CSGO which is brilliant. Such as small things that could be exploited in competitive games, such as the saving mechanic. In CS if you die, you lose all your weapons, they will be dumped on the ground for another enemy to come along and pickup, players if they knew they were going to use they would hide away from the enemies, so they would be able to keep there gun for the next around, the problem with this is that they would still get money from doing this, and therefore be exploiting the system in some peoples opinion, it was recently fixed that instead of getting money if you lose and you’re still alive you simply gain $0. The CSGO match making system is an exceptional feature, the ability to play against players that are at the same skill level is much better than being forced to browse through thousands of servers in attempt to find one that suits you with a enemy team you can play against, and it is a fun game for both teams instead of one team getting obliterated by the other. Matchmaking works by waiting till you have 10 wins or 9 wins and a draw on your account before being rewarded with a competitive rank. Here are all the current ranks available in game.  Many people seem to think that this is like COD, you simply rank up from playing the game, no this is not true. You rank up as your skill improved, if you play well for a few weeks, and you finally get the Gold Nova you’ve been wanting for ages, and then you proceed to play awfully for a long time there is a very likely chance you will be deranked sadly, it’s for the best, you will be matched against players who are around the same skill level. Recently a feature that allowed you to watch your recent games has been implemented into the game, this is in now way “ground breaking” it’s been done by other games before, but they have there issues, although I have not got round to actually trying out this feature I have been told that it appears to be working considerably well. The watch feature is great for those who enjoy re watching those moments of which they pulled of that beautiful AWP shot, or got that 5-kill ace. I would like to say in this final paragraph, of the 250 hours+ I have played of this game I have seriously enjoyed (almost) every moment of it, sure there are some hackers, but you have to make sure to report them and they will be dealt with. All the factors about this game are good, but as all games go by, they have there problems, sure if CSGO has improved graphics that would be nice, and if *breathes in heavily* VALVE WOULD ADD 128 TICK MATCH MAKING SERVERS… this has caused some annoyance for me in match making, if you don’t understand what’s so bad about 64 tick, I suggest you watch this video: Anyway, I highly suggest you buy this game, apart from my small rant at the end, and game is fine, good game mechanics, graphics are sort of good, I supposed most of the maps are well balanced, there are a few that I suggest you shouldn’t play though. The game has a small price tag, which I am sure will attract you to it even more, especially when it’s on sale at 75% of! Hope you enjoyed reading my game review of Counter Strike: Global Offensive, and that this assisted you in making the decision of whether to buy the game or not."

T0ny.,False,"Valve just released a new update giving each traded item a tradeban of 7 days, which absolutely killed trading for now.

Best way to discribe valve managment is this picture:   (source: Roo_ooky on Reddit). Make trading great again!"

Purple,False,"It was a good game. But we paid for it and now it is free? At least give us a refund. But in all seriousness, when the game is free, VAC ban means nothing. It is VERY easy to hack CSGO, and now that VAC doesn't mean anything, there are LOTS of hackers. This was once a great game, but now it is a waste of time. There are better games out there. Games without hackers. Don't waste your time on this."
Hey,False,The games decent. Those are the good things. Now here are 10 reasons not to play this 'Great Family Friendly Game' 1. TOXIC COMMUNITY. 2. Very unbalanced. (a pistol can kill someone with a ak-47... 3. Way to many cheaters 4. Way to many Griefers/Derankers 5. You're going to get dumb  kids who buy $150 knifes with there mums credit card who will call you poor... (from experience) 6. No one in the lower ranks takes the game seriously which can be a big pain for new players wanting to actually play the game properly 7. Only like 10-20 people work on the game. Which is why you get useless/boring updates (operation hydra) 8. Valve only care about the money  9. Valve don't listen to the community who could make the game so much better but instead they put alot more money into dota 2... 10. And finally but almost obvious... Valve's VAC system on csgo is just as terrible as the community.
Rose††a S†oned,False,"HI! I was playing Counter Strike, while 2 kids were flooding/ spamming the mic, in a language I did not understand, which obviously wasn't English. In this specific game, I was leading, and the team was winning. So I asked them to be quiet, and suddenly all the team decided to kick me. It happened to  be that the whole team knew their language. So tell me please, why do I have to suffer from 12 year old kids/ get kicked when it's not my fault, and ruin my rank??? That's why I spent 15$ on a game and I can't even enjoy it???  It seems to me that you are running from your responsibilities, kids kicking good players, Counter Strike's poor ""vac"" performances, every freaking game contains at least one cheater and tons of rasist comments. And by the way, I was kicked twice because I muted my ""fellow"" teammates, cause they were spamming the mic, and I was kicked cause I didn't listen for their directions.  It's unfeair, and due to all the hours, the money and the efforts I spent, I can't even enjoy my favorite game."
ghad,False,"The game is not fun, it is not rewarding to play, you will not enjoy yourself, you will not make any significant progress in the complete abortion of a competetive ladder, and you will hate yourself because of it. You will spend your practice time either alone wishing you didn't care, or surrounded by players better than you that would rather call you a retard than actually offer any tangible piece of useful advice. You will spend your 'real' play time surrounded by people who have clearly not put in the practice you have, or at least don't seem to put it to use, and wonder why you ever bothered in the first place.  You will spend yet more of your time watching professional matches and thinking to yourself either, 'I could do that,' or, 'I could never do that.' But it doesn't matter either way, because you'll never get the chance. The competition to become a professional is so fierce that you have better odds at surviving a stroll across a busy eight lane highway than even approaching the professional level. Valve is so bad at communicating with their (unreasonably dedicated) community that it is sometimes physically painful when Valve releases an update to the game. Thinking back on all of the bad decisions Valve has made with the game, and all of the (actually quite straight-forward) things that the community wants and has still yet to receive after almost five years of asking, I sometimes find it impossible to believe that people not only don't hate Valve the way that they hate EA or Ubisoft, but in fact still defend and   them. The AWP nerf, the overpowered CZ, the overpowered AUG, the ♥♥♥♥ing R8 revolver, the timer changes, the coaching decision, the lifetime ban of players for throwing an ultimately meaningless match in a tournament completely unrelated to valve, the rifle nerfs, the completely broken pistols, the new sounds, the completely and utterly broken Tec-9, and oh yeah, the ♥♥♥♥ing pocket AWP that one shots people in the chest for $850, and the list goes on and on. Oh but, they fixed the hitboxes once and so we love them! And all of this is leaving aside ♥♥♥♥ing skins. Talk about a way to make a game immediately turn into actual toxic waste: add an in-game economy based on paying $2.50 for a spin on a virtual slot machine that will overwhelmingly contain a skin worth approximately 10% of the price you paid to acquire it. If you want a surefire way to make sure your game rakes in hundreds of millions of dollars a year and simultaneously make sure that nobody playing your game gives a single♥♥♥♥♥♥about the game itself, there's no simpler system than a virtual goddamned casino. But, you know, they made the game so, like, good for Valve! Let's have a round of applause for Valve, the company that singlehandedly turned an entire generation into gambling addicts!  This game is a broken pile of neglected♥♥♥♥♥♥with no redeeming qualities, barring an unintended engine exploit dating back to 1996, that the current devs have tried their best to kill anyways. Do not buy this game if you value your time, your mental health, your money, or your morality."

Javro,True,"the book is better, 9/11 would bomb again"
Nero,True,:-|
ForestWolf,True,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a First Person Shooter set in a comptetetive scene where two teams battle for an objective. It is a stand-alone follow-up to the famous Counter-Strike mod from Half-Life where terrorists battle the Counter-Terrorists on different locations. The gameplay consists of buying weapons and shooting your opponents. Easier said than done actually, since your opponents are either human players sitting on the other side of the world wide web or some AI programmed to shoot you first. CS:GO is for a reason the biggest competetive shooter on the market for years, since it offers great weapon balance, tactical possibilities for teams to approach and a large player base that keeps growning each day. The story behind the game is based on the oldschool Counter-Strike game, where one side takes the approach as terrorists either trying to plant a bomb or protect the hostages and other being Counter-Terrorists either try to protect a bomb site or trying to rescue the hostages held at Terrorist base.  The combat is absolutely fluid in CS:GO and there are barely any moments, that you could blame the broken hitboxes or the bad netcode for dying. People tend to rage and blame the bad balance on maps, weapons or programming of the game, however the success of this title proves that it is the best competetive shooter on the market. The challenge in this game is definetely to be able to rise through the ranks in competetive matches, playing against hackers on opposite team or some players on your team that want to teach you some bad words in russian or french. I am always thankful for such opportunities to improve my language skills and consider it just a chance of becoming even better if I did not win the match no matter the team stacks. Reaching Global Elite rank after around 200 hours, I can safely say that it is possible to rise to the top even when the odds are stacking against you. The graphic when set to higher settings is actually pretty good, sadly the competetive scene barely allows it since there are certain tricks like setting your resolution lower on purpose to be able to aim better, that crash the feeling of this game in graphical matters. Most of the maps contain some details that make them distinguishable, like certain grapphiti on some maps. The interface is kept simple and almost transparent so that it does not disturb the concentration. It is possible to consider progress by rising up the account level that comes from simply playing CS:GO in any form, there are forms of rising up your ranking by playing competetive or gathering skins for the weapons you are using or want to sell. Some people actually make money by playing this game and selling the skins on the steam market, so different ways to progress in and outside of the game. The biggest progress for me was improving my hand-to-eye coordination by playing it competetively. Each weapon sound is unique for itself, and since the sound plays a great role in this game it is really important to get to know the sounds and be able to distinguish where the shooting is coming from. CS:GO fulfills its task really well. The music is played only in menues and during the highlights. The game music is nothing special, but since you can get/buy music kits to fit your music taste, Valve found a good workaround for not creating amazing music by themselves. CS:GO has its reasons to be the Number One FPS in the ESL Scene and its popularity is currently only rising. It is great to see that it has not been abandoned by the developers after reaching its peak state, but still keeps getting updated. I would recommend trying CS:GO to every game, just to know what this game is that defines the global FPS market so much and while FPS fans might love it, some might well get turned off by the hardcore players or the cursing and spitting wanna-bes. I hope this review helps you making the decision if its worth buying and installing this game. Rate and leave a comment if you enjoyed reading it. ~ForestWolf"

It has a nice mix of strategy and skill to deliver a pretty good gameplay experience. But by god the community is more toxic than nuclear reactor made out of concentrated cyanide having a meltdown.

tygah ❤,False,"I personally enjoy the game, and continue to play it frequently. But the point of this review system is to let people who haven't bought it know about what they're getting in to. That's why I don't recommend it.  If you jump into casual to learn the ropes and play with other people there's a 90% you'll get kicked because you don't know how to play, didn't defuse the bomb because you don't know where it is, or maybe you'll get kicked just because someone called a vote for no reason and everyone hit F1 because it's a funny me me to kick people for no reason. You'll get abused over mic and text chat constantly until you ""git gud"", and then even when you do it will still continue. If you play competitve to try and get better and progress through the skill ranks there's a 90% chance you will get yelled at continuously if you are last alive, pointing out everything you do wrong in their eyes, even though they are already dead. This games community is absolutely terrible and while there are nice people that just want to have fun or help out new people, they are a dime a dozen. If you think you'll be fine with all this go right ahead and buy it, it's an incredibly satisfying feeling when you can play, and even moreso when you do those pro™ strats™. But for new players this is an awful game that continues to insult you until you don't want to play anymore, it's happened to more than a few of my friends that tried to get in to it. Overall, great game if you persist, terrible game if you want to jump in to it casually"

Desolater IV,True,"+ Plenty of well designed maps + Visually very appealing + Very high player population with great matchmaking that will get you in a game in less than a minute at any time of the day. + The Arms Race or ""Gun Game"" mode is a favorite of mine. Essentially every time you get a kill you upgrade to a new weapon which is a lot of fun. + Nice selection of guns + Great Sound Effects ~  A bit too competitive. People take this game extremely seriously and spend hundreds if not thousands of hours memorizing the map and perfecting their aim. Some might love this, others may hate this aspect.  - You die extremely fast in this game, and can not regain health. - Very repetitive. There isn't many game modes, and you mainly end up playing Bomb Defusal (which is basically Search & Destroy if you are more familiar with Call of Duty) - Microtransactions ""Skins"" which are very costly - I feel like Counter Strike lacks features that other shooters have. ADS (Aiming Down Site), Vehicles, Gametypes, Killstreaks, Leveling / Progression / Unlock systems, destructable environments, going prone, sliding, leaning, etc. - In competitive play, a large portion of time is spent watching others play. After you die, you must wait for the round to finish by spectating others.  [keep in mind these are opinions]"

✪ megapull,True,"""This sh*t is actually hilarious. If I'm playing CS, during the time I play, I'm not even, like, having fun, I swear to God. It's like f*cking intense, I'm heated all the time, I'm p*ssed... I'm like, f*cking mad. And then after, I'm like 'sh*t bro, I wanna play some more Counter-Strike'... like literally afterwards, I'm like 'God damn bro, I love Counter-Strike, dude'... It's weird what Counter-Strike is. It's a game you hate while playing it, but then you just miss it... you just miss playing it. You just have so much fun. Honest to God, I'm not f*ckin' around with you guys."" - JasonR ""Soo... kind of like heroin."" - Me ______________________________________________________________ EDIT - As of the Battle Royale Update on Dec 6: Disclaimer: No, this will not be bashing the BR gamemode. I play CS since 2001. Time and time again, I see Valve do the following: - Release an update that is outrageous in some way, be it positive or negative (AUG week, Revolver month + spread RNG, Battle Royale) - Combine it with a case - Make it sure that the update either goes directly against or contains nothing what the core players wanted This will result in: - Streamers and the general gamer community talking about and streaming the game.... for a few weeks - Core players getting alienated - Casuals getting dragged in more (not a problem per se) - Newcomers seeing this as their first impression of CSGO - More $$$ It is fine that we have a new gamemode, no matter how good/bad it is. The real problem is that the needs of the core players, the people who truly love CSGO for what it is, are ignored time and time again. I'm pretty sure everyone on this sub can name at least 5 things that would make the game better. Free to play is not one of them. If there is a single problem with the game in the past 20 years, it has always been cheating. VACnet showed some improvement but every account made before yesterday getting prime, and making the game free to play while tr. ust factor is still flaw. ed majorly is not a good decision. Even more so that the game has always been at least in the top 10-15 on the top sellers list ever since it existed. I get that the main money well is the microtransactions. But will they sell more skins if csgo is F2P? In BR you won't even see most of your skins, not to mention that the skin prices may be on the decline (speculation) because of this move. CSGO is a great game, but it has always been centered around its competitive nature, the high-pressure skill based gameplay, and this is why it has stayed alive for so long. Nevertheless, the casual players are super important for CSGO as well, and this is why the game needs something to keep them entertained too. A welcome change would be 5v5 unranked, which would benefit both HC and casual players. In valve's eyes, this was BR. A questionable choice, if you ask me. What scares me is the direction Valve is seemingly taking the game. I was not expecting things that are pretty much unrealistic at this point, namely 128 tick (a huge part of the playerbase does not have 128 FPS to benefit from this change), but this was the polar opposite of my expectations. Playing BR in the source engine feels like playing football with a tennis racket. It is just not adequate, because it was not meant for this. If you take a list of things that the devs freshly implemented to the game (Weapon spray RNG, AUG week, Revolver, CZ75, Tec9, and so on), you will notice that every single one of these changes were either completely reverted or nerfed into oblivion so no one uses them anymore. There are a few outliers though where they did the balance just right, and that shows me promise. But overall, it is not a good score. What is also important is the first impression newcomers will get of CS. If you never saw the game and this is the first thing you see, what would be your opinion? CS is amazing because you can get it, get good at it, so much so that you can play for a $40k prize pool every friggin' month, and that's what it's all about! Shroud said it in his stream that nobody will play this in a week. JasonR won a game after being alt tabbed during most of the time, and he shot 1 bullet total. The name of his stream was ""csgo is ruined"". CSGO was on top of twitch for around 12 hours. Now the most viewed streamer in the CSGO category is playing with something else, the second most viewed is playing Faceit."

volka,True,"Basic Gameplay You play as either a Counter-Terrorist or a Terrorist, both of which are deployed into a battlefield and each round are giving a small allowance to purchase weapons of their choice. You can make extra money by winning rounds or you could also hold a knife up to the enemy demanding their money, Although that would be risky since the enemy would likely just to shoot you. On the Terrorist team your goal is to plant and explosive near some uhhm.. important boxes?. Anyway, once plant wait You patiently for it to explode. As a Counter-terrorist you must eliminate all the Terrorist forces OR defuse the bomb, thus Protecting those ever important boxes from certain destruction. Being a honourable opponent, Terrorists are sure to set the bomb timer just long enough to give the Ct's the chance to Slaughter the remaining T's, and defuse the bomb. I'll list some positive/negative attributes of this game here. Positive attributes : - Matchmaking  - Teaches children the harsh reality of gambling (although some never seem to learn even after $500 later) - Ranks   - Cool looking skins - Fast growing population of players   - Fat stacks of loot dropped somewhat often - Chickens - High replay value - Deathmatch game type (I could go into more detail on negative parts of it, but that would make this review too long and boring) Negative attributes : Although I Do love the single player campaign, it could use some work.  I REALLY wish it were longer..  And that final Boss fight is pretty lame. It only lasts around 27 seconds, and during that time the only way to lose is by taking offense from the old man that constantly insults you, and how his ""7 year old could beat you, blindfolded."" - The game mode ""Infernal"" played on the map ""de_inferno"" Some people like this game mode however I personally dislike it, For those of you that have not yet had the chance to experience it I'll explain for you. It seems like any normal de_ map However, The real goal is to scurry around finding any shred or scrap of rego, Normally it's hidden in obscurer unused sections of the map, and has the ability to shift/move around to different locations, Or even leave the game entirely for up to 10 minutes at a time. - Demolition, Also known as ""jokemode"" Added purely as a joke that volvo was supposed to only unlock on every April fool's day, However some hacker probably that ""4_chan"" guy, permanently unlocked it. (Volvo have been working on a fix ever since) Demolition is the game mode which automatically gives everyone amour and then requires you to get kills with weapons that do extremely poor damage against armoured opponents. Also no block is Enabled And Whoa?, So is team killing! The volka Strategy You could just play this game like a noob and spend hundreds of dollars on skins, OR  you could play the game correctly like me.  Here is my strategy : -  Don't buy skins to start with, Seriously it's a waste of money. -  Play for a good 50 hrs or so and sell any drop you get. - Wait for a steam sale and Invest in as many copies of csgo you can. - Work your way up to about 5 copies or so But make sure you don't get too many otherwise you won't have enough time to harvest all your csgo account drops (having more than 7 accounts may have diminishing returns) [Note- it takes about 20 hrs gameplay to activate the drops]. - Keep playing on all copies frequently to maximise drops. - Once you have your economy built up with this method you can now buy skins with all that free income you have. Remember to Never gamble with opening cases. I've made about $100 with this method. I think it's about time to quit my day job. In a whole, I do love this game And would recommend to anyone, Good half, Good half."
De-Psy-Sieve,True,"Honestly, whether you can aim or not is irrelevant. The TRUE definition of skill is your ability to argue with everyone. people being put into 5v5 teams is just to create the illusion of a team game. It's actually 1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1. Whoever rustles the most jimmies wins. Also just like to add that the Russians are currently dominating at this sport at the moment."

I have had a lot of great moments in the game, including meeting many of the people I know today. The controls are orderly, the look is clean. Though the community may be generally cancerous, I have meet and seen people who aren't. The fact that operations are also optional,, also is very nice, because unlike other shooters, this game still allows you to enjoy the maps without the pass. And the developers, whom are some of the best listeners ever, attending to (almost) every bug and detail, and constantly updating the game. I definitely will play more in the future with no plan on stopping."

PewPewPew,True,"Since an old fan of Halo games i find, CS:GO a nice sequel to the franchise. You can jump with p90, AWP or AK and make headshots, like a true spartan. I like it, since with p90 is so ez that i'm eagle right now and i'm going supreme easly, only thanks to this weapon. Then the real DLC that this game deserve: The russians. Halo had no russian, and this game is full of it.  Since the game is so easy that is more hard to play in silver levels than in eagle levels, the Russians make the game quite challenging. Like when you got one in your team, you know that the game will be a thug battle. (Just kidding Love y'all! <3) Thanks Valve for the best Hal.. ehm CS you have ever made."

Norv,False,"Heads up, I will still be playing this game since the game itself is very good and addicting, just read the thumbs down. Counter-Strike has made it's way to one or maybe the best first person competitive shooter, every gun has to be mastered atleast decently to win the gun fights between you and the enemy. A very fun and challenging shooter with it's own unique mechanics and matchmaking system. Anyone that's interested in tactical shooters will most likely buy the game, expecting a whole new experience between strategy and skill. This is where most players quit. The expectation of the looks and mechanics are the same as they have seen in either a video or stream. A youtuber who enjoys a match of solo queue. What they get: - Higher skilled players with new accounts ruining low ranks - Cheaters - A Toxic community - Trolls Every game I have played was there was 70% smurfs and the rest trolls and cheaters. Doing all the wrong and screwing over the matchmaking system where it becomes unfair for newer people that still have to learn, as for the toxic community flaming and blaming the new ones for trying to learn the game. (votekicking) Ofcourse there are alternatives matchmaking clients but new people do a little bit know that their skill won't fit for that. I recommend you to queue with 4 friends and that you play regularly with them, that is the best way to learn and not be screwed over by a team griefer. So do I recommend the game itself? Yes, I love how you have to use both of your brain and skill to win the game. Do I recommend the game to new people reading this? If you want to buy it, then buy it, thats up to you since it's your money. The reason I won't recommend it is that it will be very hard to learn and enjoy the game. Ofcourse not everyone is a scumbag, it's just that the game won't be fun as you tought it was by these people and I don't want you to waste your time and money."

Big Stinky,True,"If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place. Ingredients: 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie  Directions: 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."
Pepsiman,True,"Counter Strike: Global Offensive is one of those games that is kind of hard not to recommend. It's a solid shooter and it is cheap and looks really good for a game that runs on the Source engine. To new players CSGO may feel a little ""back to the basics"" as this game does not have aiming down the sight, unlocks, attachments, perks and killstreaks so it's heavily based on player skill and not on selecting the perfect loadout with the perfect perks. This game does have a ranking system but it's different from all the other shooters which I'll explain later on. But the game does show a lot of depth as you play more and you will find out that not everything is as straight forward as it might have looked. It's also a tactical teamplay based shooter, so don't even think about buying it if you don't like teamplay. Only a good team can lead you to victory, not a highly skilled lone wolf. CSGO offers a small variety of game modes, those are: Deathmatch, Arms race, Demolition, Classic casual and Classic competitive. For those of you who are familiar with COD Arms race is called Gun game in COD. You start off with a weapon and every time you kill someone you'll advance to the next weapon until you get a golden knife, kill someone with the golden knife and you win the game. What's rather interesting about Arms race is that you still play in teams 5v5 but the one who killed enemies with all weapons wins. Demolition is a combination between Classic (I’ll explain classic later in the review) and arms race. The goal is to plant the bomb as a terrorist or defend the bombsites as a counter terrorist or defuse the bomb if its planted, there are no respawns and instead of buying a weapon you start with one and advance to the next weapon if you made any kills during the last round and if you made more than one kill you'll get extra rewards like frag grenades and flash bangs. In my opinion those game modes are fun but unnecessary because I never really feel the need to play them. There's also deathmatch which is a little different from the usual (team)deathmatch. It's played 5V5 and all weapons are available except for grenades. you play in a team but it's every man for himself as the person with the most points at the end of a round wins. What's also interesting about Deathmatch is that different weapons give a different amount of points and at some point during deathmatch certain weapons give bonus points. In my opinion deathmatch shouldn't be taken to serious, It's a good gamemode to improve your aim, and I know most new players will jump right into deathmatch but that's in my opinion not the way Counter Strike is supposed to be played. So that leaves Classic casual and Classic competitive which are almost the same gamemodes, therefore I’ll use this section to talk about the things these gamemodes have in common and in the next section the differences between these gamemodes. Classic consists of the two original Counter Strike game modes: defuse mission and hostage mission. In hostage mission the counter terrorists have to kill all the terrorists or rescue one of the hostages (in the other counter strike games all the hostages have to be rescued) and the terrorists have to prevent the counter terrorists from rescuing the hostages by killing all of the counter terrorists. In defuse mission the terrorists have to plan a bomb at one of the two bombsites and make it explode or kill all the counter terrorists and the counter terrorists have to win by killing all the terrorists or by defusing the bomb if it's planted in which case killing all the terrorists does not result in victory. Both defusal mission and hostage mission have a money system. You'll receive money for all sorts of things, playing a round, of course the winning team receives more in most cases, completing a part of the objective like taking a hostage or planting the bomb and kills. The kill reward depends on the weapon, a rifle or pistol will give you 1× kill reward while an SMG (except for P90) gives you 2× kill reward, a shotgun gives 3× kill reward and a knife gives 5× kill reward while the AWP gives only 0,5× kill reward. At the start of a new round you can buy weapons and grenades with the money you earned and the money you don't spend will carry over to the next round. So now the differences between casual and competitive. In casual you play either terrorist or counter terrorist and the best team out of 15 rounds wins, in competitive the teams are swapt after the 15th round and the best team out of 30 rounds wins. In casual you'll receive more money if you lose a round, less if you win a round and the kill reward for a rifle is 150 bucks while a kill with a rifle in competitive rewards 300, the developer did it this way to balance the difference in money between the good and bad team and the good and bad players in casual. Competitive is played 5V5 and casual can be played 10V10. In competitive you have to buy your armor and your defuse kit while you get those for free in casual. In casual you can just drop in a round and leave whenever you desire while in competitive you join at the start of a game and you're not supposed to leave until the game is finished, because if you do you'll get a penalty in the form of a temporary competitive ban ranging between half an hour and 7 days and I've seen screenshots of people getting over 200 days competitive cooldown. This is both fair and unfair as it will punish the players who ragequit, the more they ragequit the longer the cooldown, but sometimes you can lose connection to the server because of server problems or internet problems in which case you'll also receive a cooldown which is highly unfair. If you play casual you'll play with random people while competitive has a ranking system based on your skill and win/lose ratio and you'll play with people of the same skill level as you. There's also a community server browser with servers that have different game rules, use community maps or even have completely different game modes. I don't spend a lot of time on community servers so I can't tell you more than this. In my opinion competitive is the way to play CSGO, I spend by far most of my time playing competitive. Casual is great for practice but keep in mind that people play different on competitive. If you're new though I advice to play a few rounds on casual before playing competitive so you can learn how the gamemode works, how the economy system works and gain some map knowledge, why should you do this in casual? Well competitive is way more serious. There's also an option to play against bots if you're new to shooters but even expert bots are pretty easy to defeat and play really different than human players. The only negative points I can come up with is that the servers have to be improved as hit detection doesn't always works as it is supposed to work, and the ranking system has to be improved. At the time of writing I am silver elite master (fifth rank) but some silver elites (fourth rank) are way better than me and some golden nova 2 players (seventh rank) are much worse. And they could crank up the difficulty of the bots as medium bots in CS:S are way harder than expert bots in CSGO making bot practice less useful. Over the last year this has definitely become my favorite shooter, I even watch CSGO E-sport. It's a crown jewel and it only costs 14 bucks. I give CSGO a 10/10. This doesn't mean the game is perfect, of course it can be improved but it's based on the fun factor, and even though I sometimes HATE this game out of pure frustration, I'll always come back to it and there are barely any games out there that can do that. Everyone who remotely likes shooters should buy it."

The game is well put together and i never have isues with performance and i cant recal a time where i have experienced a game breaking glitch. playing with your friends competitively can be very fun. Making your way up the ranks is sometimes very hard but when you finaly acomplish your goal it is very satisfying.

♛ThatSimCrafter♛,True,Hey If you have a life..  then don't buy this game. It will F up ur life.  I'm warning you now. Back away 760 hours within like 3 months... I need help.  This game takes ur money with ur addition to buying cases and making a -2.00 dollar profit.  Your only friends will be the friends you meet in a casual game.  Your family will think you have died. Your voice will get lost from raging too much. You won't have a computer after you punch it.  You don't need to take a language class when you got csgo. If you thought little kids are cute.. Then meet one in a csgo game.  If your a girl prepared for stalker guys coming to hunt u down. ;) And you will learn that ur a hacker just because you get a head shot.... basically you will die. Good luck 69/10 would die again for this game.

Ryanes Cheap SFM stuff!,False,"CS:GO a game, that forces you to blow. Counter strike global offensive, is a sequel to a game not many mention, that is the more tame and passive counter strike source, or at least by comparison. When you get CS:GO you will immediately know, that you're gonna be bad and quickly get mad. And if you aren't aware of the haulage of rage in less than a minute, your ""teammates"" will acknowledge and flip it on. Never in my life, have I been in a situation where I wanted people from another nation to be on my team. Because with most of the american players, they do nothing but add layers of irritation and stress, mostly screaming kids or random mooks making bids for weapons while ignoring their dames, when they should be playing the game, that it causes such a mess. The main game is all the same. If you're a terrorist your goal is to blow up things, like a horrible chemist. If you're a counter terrorist, you'll find yourself defending one of two spots like a minimum wage therapist. Both teams do have an alternative option, that they aren't too furtive about. Everyone usually goes for this route, and just kill everyone on the other team without a doubt.  This game is not new user friendly,  I dare say it is quite deadly to newbies. To sum things up, before I get mad and break a cup. It feels like everyone is a 5 year veteran, but you are some poor letterman that gets headshot instantly and spent more time dead than alive. Your accuracy is off like a dead battery, but every bullet from each enemy is specially graced by gaben to carve a mullet into your skull. It doesn't help, that this games community is rancid, if you dare yelp everyone will shout at you like you're a whelp. Not to mention the huge amount of smurfs, that make you feel like you're in detention.  Don't even bother unboxing, because it is outright mocking you what little difference it makes. All you can get is a skin, which is as worthless as the bin you'll put it in. All the guns work, but apparently aren't as fun without bright colors stickers glowsticks or prickers. And don't dilude yourself that if you keep trying you'll get a knife, it'll be a very pitiful strife.  And the worst part, that makes the first statement of this review meanginless?  This game makes you always feel bad, I rarely see anyone glad to be having fun at all. CS:GO makes you feel like you blow. There is one thing that is a big deal to the smurfs, that they gladly take and seal. But the problem that always hits without fail is, this game is always on bloody sale. So for 40 bucks, the average chucks can have about 8 accounts. So even if they do get a ban, it'll literally be like you threw a rotten tomato at a fan. Just more of a fuss that oozes from this toxic community, like a wound full of puss. You may ask yourself, ""why does this random delph still play it then?"" The answer is simple, like connect the dots with dimples. This game has challenge, and does need ""teamwork"" to make you do better than an allonge. Which you'll rarely get alone, it cannot be done. Bring a friend, because in the end it is better to suffer together rather than alone. Otherwise can't recommend."

unremarkable player,True,"It's hard to argue that this game is probably the best CS release since 1.6. Some will disagree, might argue Source is a better game and they will have their own valid points. In my opinion this game is a true sequel. It brings the fun and nostalgia from the earlier versions of CS, the same flowing game play that made it popular and the heavy emphasis on team game play. It mates the old with the new; the expectations that a FPS be somewhat realistic if not fun to play. It's a modern game; it looks and plays like modern games should but it all looks a bit familiar, like the hot girl from years past that you bump into 10 years later.  CS:GO is more technical and team oriented than previous games in the series. Shooting, movement, sound and grenades are completely different and you have to master them once again. Weapons now have a purpose - there's a reason to buy the 5-7 and P250, as well as the MP5 replacement, MP7. Team play is just as important as the economy; once you lose it there's no coming back. It's a demanding skills based that's as satisfying as any CS title has been.   - Updated maps, visuals & sounds  - Emphasis on team play  - Valve online matchmaking as well as valve casual servers  - Extensive customisability & player drops  - More realistic player and game behaviour  - CS:GO workshop  - Pro players  - Active development and regular updates  - Listens to community  - Low-end modern PC requirements for top quality & top resolution  - Gungame isn't the same as CS:S  - Because of different skills & tactics, CS:S players will feel like it's a familiar but new game. Skills are transferrable one way, not so much the other; when you play CS:S after CS:GO it will feel and sound like you're playing underwater.  - Sound still seems like an afterthought  - You will need to upgrade your video card to something made in the last 3 years if you want something that's playable and looks good Graphics: 8.5/10, far improved on previous models but there's still room for improvement Sound: 8/10, feels like an after-thought, if there's one complaint I have about the game it is that the sound quality and engine just isn't good enough Gameplay: 9.5/10, excellent and extremely playable game with very high replayability Overall: 8.5/10, it's a great game and could easily be 9.5 out of 10 with improved audio and slight improvements in visual quality. It's a modern twist on an old classic. I lost my way with CS after CS:S and I turned to a variety of other games. Battlefield 1942/2142/2/3, Tom Clancy Rainbow 6, America's Army 2/3/PG. Before then I was an avid player of CS and I would play up to 100 hours per month. When I played CS 10 years ago I always asked, why can't this game be a little more realistic? Why can't they stop people from shooting through 3 walls 20 metres apart and killing with me an awp? Why do grenades act like balloons and float through the air? I can't really emphasise how happy I am that a lot of what shouldn't happen has been removed and the overall quality of visuals, sound and game play has been improved. In the first month of playing I managed to rack up 200 hours of gameplay and I've started contributing back to the community with maps."

Boosted ones. They are too good for this world, they are smart, handsome and incredible. But Gold Nova 2. And they think their peoblem is always with teams that not_so_good. Eventually they are ruining games with their conceit and lack of experience.  Skin haters. People that consider it's their business to count other people's money. Also, they are confident high price skins owners are bad because... IT IS FUN TO MAKE A MEME ""GE INVENTORY (pic with sand dunes) /SILVER INVENTORY (pic with knieves). Ha-haaa, dem memes... BOT lovers. Some people think the BOT will be better than the player that didn't clutch the round with 10 hp left and all enemy team alive. Common idiots. Actually press f1. I WILL FIGHT TILL THE LAST BREATH ones. For some reason they never surrender. A competitive game is played between the teams of 5 players. If one of them leaves the game prematurely, he receives a penalty, and the team devoid of player has the right to end the game in advance. Valve gave them this feature, but they prefer to waste time and lose because of the numerical superiority of the enemy team. Tryhards. Goes without any words :> Team players you can count on. People that will give you info AND call idiot, noob, retard etc. at the same time, when they're already died and whatch you. They don't know what morale is. And manners. The community most valuable members. They want to be the bride at every wedding and the corpse at every funeral. This is not about CS:GO only.

For example: you lost the round 1 by 1 with the enemy, because couldn't handle aim? Dead one pro will cheer you with the words ""omg what an aim noob"" or something like that. I don't know where they take such a weird ideas of omnipotence or invincibility... Everyone have equal abilities here. Smurfs. People that find it fun to play with people that can't resist. Welp, as you see, nothing in this community is friendly. Russians. Do you think I forgot?) Russian ones are odd. They always ask this question ""Русские есть?"". This questions is very mystical, because even if they get positive answer... they keep silence. So, do you want to met... or you just show off your nationality?

#`GHo$T .. !™,True,love this game :$ it's getting closer and closer to 1.6 while﻿ still retaining all of what I like about source.
JUB JUB,True,"I thank TrulyRazor for buying this for me a long time ago -- I insisted to him that I would not play it. Seems I was wrong. Most around me have always known me for, perhaps not absolutely hating, but at the very least showing some amount of contempt and disdain for all things Counter-Strike. I should address this before talking about why the game has value.  One component of my dislike was cured by playing it, as I knew it would. I simply did not understand the game, most of the mechanics seemed counter-intuitive and frustrating. This changed as I played and came to understand the game -- I expected that. The other element of my dislike for Counter-Strike in general has remained unchanged. The elitism of its players and the toxic, cancerous nature of the community itself.  The elitism comes in the form of treating Counter-Strike as if it were above other shooters that do not aim to do what it does.  Call of Duty, with its fun, arcade shooting must be seen as garbage, and Halo with its slower-paced shooting with sci-fi shields/weapons/tech must also be bad, for it is different. Battlefield too, not having recoil patterns that take months to completely memorize, is clearly for the trash heap. Inane comments like these come from a simple ignorance about different things serving different purposes, but it is obnoxious nonetheless. The cancerous community is really just that, cancerous. Many talk of Russians in silver matchmaking, I have not encountered this.  I have however, encountered toxic, alpha-male types who yell, complain, and belittle others -- who put down their teammates, make them feel like crap, etc. I have encountered all possible types of cringy weeaboos, bronies, and people who recite old memes in deathmatch lobbies and think they're funny. People who make the lamest, overused jokes and think it's hilarious, people who just scream and make noises for shock value. Standard fare for most online shooters but CSGO has a LOT of this. So, yeah, this game has one of the worst communities out there. It's true. It doesn't, however, make the game wholly bad. On to why the game is good. The game does have a very steep learning curve. Slowly coming to understand the way the game works, the importance of each part is satisfying. As you learn positioning, grenade throws, crosshair placement, recoil patterns, and so on you can feel yourself getting better at the game.  Not trying very hard and not understanding either immediately ranked me at Silver III when I started. The slow process of getting better and rising through the ranks is immensely satisfying and enjoyable -- I'm now Legendary Eagle (SMFC now). It taught me a lot of patience and willingness to push on even when frustrated.  While most of the maps are CT-sided, they are all designed with a great deal of balance in mind. The weapons too, their costs, their recoil, each having drawbacks, give balance to the game. All the elements combined -- the economy, the guns, the maps, positioning, timing, recoil, grenade throws, sound, etc -- and you get a very tense, balanced shooter.  There are very few situations where it could not go either way -- if skill levels are equal, I am not claiming silvers have much chance against high-level smurfs. Speaking generally, equally matched players in an average game have an equal chance to win and things can quickly turn around for the whole game  or for any single round if one smart player knows what's going on. I know it's easy to be cynical about bad teammates or people who don't listen, but that's not really got to do with the quality of the game, I'm simply talking about how it should play out ideally. A good game of Counter-Strike in its ideal form is something highly enjoyable -- when teammates are listening, when plays work, when headshots connect, when the other team stands at least some chance, then the game is fantastic to play.  It is highly demanding of you, asking disciplined patience, focus, and consistency, but also highly satisfying, granting deserved victory, ranking up, and greater confidence as you become better. There are few other games like it, or that at least, provide a similar experience. I would recommend you play with friends, granted that you have friends you can trust to listen to you, take feedback, and try hard enough to improve with you.  Besides the fact that you'll have dependable people to play with, having others to complain about the game with, to share your losses and your gains definitely keeps you sane when the game is at its most frustrating.  You learn about the game together, get better together, you point out eachother's flaws and learn from their strengths -- it is, again, much more enjoyable and will also allow you to tolerate the game longer, as you'll be going through the journey with others rather than alone. It is not, honestly, a game for everyone. If you are willing to put effort into this game then you'll be rewarded. If you're a long time player and go into it every day understanding you still have a lot more to learn and discover, then again, you'll be rewarded. (I have found though that, going into ANYTHING with a renewed sense of wonder and willingness to learn grants a better experience.) I recommend this game for any and all who can put in the effort, change their play, practice consistently, learn, and expect progress to come slowly. If instant gratification is your thing, don't play this. Oh yeah, there's also the usual TF2-style item hunt for weapon skins and cases in case you're interested in wasting a lot of money -- not at all implying I am not guilty in this either. So give the game a try, just understand what you're getting into."

Kaotic,False,"They don't care about players or the game, they just care about making money, as such they'll just break the game time and time again then spend 6 months finally getting it to a great point, only to break it again. Welcome to Valve doesn't care presents ""Revolver-Strike: Revolver Offensive"". Also they only put in the revolver so people wouldn't notice the rifle changes which are stupid AF."
Hunter|AZR|,False,"Counter strike for kids! I mean.....(Activates deep manly voice) Counter strike GLOBAL OFFENSIVE  - it now includes unrealistic cartoony weapon skins perfect for that awsome Tactical anti-terrorism immersion that you can buy by using your mom's money! This game comes free with : More hackers Alot of ppl screaming and cursing in russian. People who claims they have slept with your mother. Unfair matchmaking. Tons of updates. But realy now: The game fixed alot of issues 1.6 had and makes it one of the world best competetive game ever. I'm glad they added the workshop until i found out that the only way to use an item in the workshop is when it gets imported by Valve in the game. So that is one problem. Instead of doing it the way left 4 dead 2 was doing the workshop became a toy making factory because the majority of the people upvotes Borderlands 2 style of weapon camo's. You will finaly see yourself spending alot of hours consentrating on the screen and doing workout with your fingers. When i bought the game it was playable on my laptop with around 40-75 fps. After the workshop update it got worse every time. now i can barely get 30 fps. If there was a way to dissable all the distracting skins and give fps a boost i would buy it Try out insurgency, its a great game to step over from arcady style of shooters"
Anonymous_,False,"i seriously hate when valve put free to play on their games like TF2, but this is WORSE. Now this game will be filled with hackers and other exploiters! And this also means that i wasted my 20 dollars on this! ANd plz fix the  hacks in the discription there is valve security system but i doesnt do s**t! But its still a good game..."
toc,False,"I try to make this as short as possible, but there will still be some lines of text: I bought this game near the date of the release. My Account is more than 11 years old. I bought more than 250 games. Recently my friends asked me to play competitive matches with them. I joined them, it was a hell lot of fun. BUT - I was banned (a so called ""cooldown"") for each 21 hours the last 3 days because some kind of an anti-smurf ""feature"". After winning 2 matches you will get banned (they call it cooldown, but you will actually get banned. Naming a ban cooldown doesn't change the effect). Valve FAQ says to you, this is no big deal. You can play the other game modes, like casual or against bots. Yeah, that changes everything... Not. The competitive mode is the only reason I started playing CS:GO again, and so will many others. You have to keep in mind, you bought the game, and you are getting restricted because they want to prevent smurfs trolling around. But they do the exact opposite. I will explain that later in this review. I can't say the words here I wan't to, cause that would remove this review instantly. I am so frustrated, seeing my friends play all night long, knowing it is so much fun. Yes, the gameplay is fantastic. Intense fun. But why in world isn't there some kind of filter?! I probably spent several 1000. of Euros on Steam. The only possible reason with a healthy human mind would be Valve wanting the people to buy several copies of the game. And guess what: That's what Smurfs actually do. To summarize: Smurfs buy several copies. Legit people don't. So Multiple Accounts give an ADVANTAGE to smurfs compared to legit customers. This logic must come from one real brainiac at Valve! And the best thing I just experienced: Even the draws count as a ""win"". So: If you would play very close matches (which is the intention of a functioning matchmaking system) and you always get draws, you would get banned everyday for 21 hours. That's because you need 10 wins to get ranked. And only after this first 10 wins you would get rid of this mess of a smurf protection system. This can take like forever. Even with 1 win and 1 draw per playing session, this would take at least 10 days. Beeing a normal worker, you can't even play everyday. Having a family or other RL responsibilities makes this a real torture. You have to play a month here and there single sessions for 2-3 games, than quitting(getting banned), waiting at least one day (your friends might not have the exact same time slots as you do), playing another 2-3 games, and this until you reach 10 wins. This is absolutely rediculous. A real shame. By the way: Contacting the Valve Support ends up in getting an automatic response, saying that there is no chance of getting unbanned from this anti smurf system. Maybe Valve invests more time in counting money these days...."

Honored Peasant,False,"Thi was the last straw. This is it, I will refuse to play CS:GO again with this broken new Prime system which makes it even cheaper for cheater to fix a new account. Earlier you had to play like a fool to gain Prime status which in return made Prime more secure from cheaters, since it took a long time to get it AND you had to add your phonenumbers which made it more inconvinent for those who makes new account just for cheating. But now  you can just start a new account and pay for a new prime status which is next to nothing. After all these years with CS, I finally let it die and put it to rest in my recycle bin, refuse to look back before they fix this, I hope more people do this as well to show these money grabbers that we won't stand for this. Thanks for these last 15 years Gabe and I will end this review with this, would NOT recommend this game for new players."

Sixth,True,"Hepimiz küçüklüğümüzde Counter Strike oyunlarından birini muhakkak oynamışızdır, Counter'ın yenilenen bu sürümünde Silah Yarışı başta olmak üzere Ölüm Oyunu, Rekabetçi vb gibi modlar var bunlar ana olanlar. Rekabetçi modunda bildiğimiz bomba kurup veya diğer takımın tüm üyelerini öldürme olayı var, ama sonunda size güzel hediyeler verebiliyor, ve arkadaşlarınızla takım oluşturup rekabetçide diğerlerine karşı yarışabiliyorsunuz. Oyunun marketi de değerli olabiliyor, örneğin rekabetçiden kazandığım bir silah şu an CS GO'nun pazarında 5 dolara tekabül ediyor. Eğer şansınız iyiyse gelen silahların bazılarını kullanıp bazılarını değerlendirerek oyunun tadını çıkarabilirsiniz. Silah Yarışında ise oyundaki tüm silahlarını kullanarak bıçağa doğru ilerliyorsunuz ve verilen her silahla bir kişi öldürmeniz gerekiyor o silahla bir kişi öldürdüğünüzde diğer silaha geçiyorsunuz ve bu bıçağa kadar böyle gidiyor, bıçakta ise en son öldürdüğünüzde modu tamamlamış oluyorsunuz.

21 Stray 乡,True,"When I was 18 I was a stereotypical socially awkward nerd.  I had really sh i t luck with women and I was afraid of each and every girl I came across. I was a virgin as well. I had only kissed a couple girls, not much other than that to be honest. My best friend, Liam, always got women. He always told me that talking to girls was easy and not scary at all, just don't be a scared little dog and do it. I always wished I had his confidence. I asked for help to get a girlfriend/someone to f u ck so I wouldn't be a virgin finally. He said he'd help me, I was so damn happy and scared at the same time. So one day he decided to take me to a party he was going to. He was content on getting me laid finally. I was nervous asf. I had a few drinks and I saw a girl I thought was a solid 8/10. A little feral though. Liam saw me looking at her and laughed. I asked him what was funny and instead he pushed me into the same girl. I apologised and was freaking out. Liam came over and said ""This here is my boy, he acts shy but he's a ????ing god. Treat him right."" and took off elsewhere. The girl giggled and told me her name was Olivia. Even thought my autism kicked in and I was a complete idiot we hit it off. A guy she knew came over and told her to come have a smoke with him. She said yes as he grabbed her hand and started walking off. She asked me if I smoked, I have never but I said yes anyway cause I wasn't letting this dog take her away from me. I inhaled my first cigarette and naturally I had a coughing fit. They laughed but it was all good. 1 year after that party I was dating Olivia. She took my virginity and we hit it off. I started smoking more often because why not, life was good. I loved her more than I will anything.  At least it was until Olivia dumped me.  Olivia cheated on me with Liam. Multiple times. The love of my life and my best mate. I became immensly depressed and started chain smoking. At least a pack a day. I did this for a solid 7 months. One day I started to feel a pain whenever I took a deep breath. I sha t myself.  I went to to doctor's to find out what was happening. I was so damn worried. My doctor said they'd call me with results after a short time. After a week my doctor called me up with some results. I was freaking the sh i t out at this point. He said I was all clear and lucky because my cells defended my body before cancer could take affect. I cried for 3 days out of relief.  I beat cancer.  Just for CSGO to give it back to me."

Khusley,True,"'CS:GO' <= Энэ ч үнэхээр хачин тоглоом шүү ... Тэгэхээр ийм байна. Тоглоомын эхэнд чи алан хядагчид эсвэл тусгайгийн цагдаа нар гэсэн хоёр багийн аль нэгэнд нь автоматаар хуваарилагдах болно. Хэрэв чамайг аз дайрвал, багт чинь 1 ширхэг орос тааралдана. Харин эсрэг тохиолдолд, 2-3 оростой нэг багт учирна гэж мэд! За тэгээд ... террористуудын гол даалгавар нь тун энгийн : тэсрэх бөмбөгөө замдаа гээлгүйхэн шиг авч явсаар 'Шороо Хоёр' гэдэг газарт модон texture-тай чулуун хайрцагнуудыг, харин 'Там' гэдэг газарт усан оргилуур доторх загаснуудыг дэлбэлж алах ёстой байгаа юм. Харин цагдаа нарын гол зорилго нь цаг дуусахаас өмнө очиж тэр бөмбөгийг нь салгаад хайрцагнуудыг, бас загаснуудыг аврахад оршино. Түүнчлэн, 'Албан Газар', 'Довтолгоо' зэрэг газруудад арай өөр дүрэм үйлчилдэг. Ердөө л шар өнгийн унтлагын хувцастай залуусыг чи А эсвэл B цэгүүдээс эсрэг багийнхандаа харагдалгүй нууцаар үүрч явсаар өөрсдийнхөө төрдөг дээрээ авчраад, шар зураасны ард гаргахад л гүйцээ! Тэгээд л чи ялах болно! Олзны хүмүүс ч аврагдах нь тэр! Браво!  Бас чамд муу тоглох эрх байхгүй. Хэрвээ муу тоглоод эхлэх юм бол багийнхан чинь чамайг урагшгүй нөхөр, олхиогүй амьтан зэргээр чинь дуудах болно. Харин тэдэнтэй сөрж хэрэлдэх гэвэл төрсөн эхийгээ элдвээр дуудуулаад дуусна шүү! Тэгээд чамайг ичих ч үгүй багаасаа хөөхөөр санал хурааж эхлэхийг нь яана! Гэхдээ, арай соёлтой нэг нь чамайг айлын өргөмөл жаал, аль эсвэл торхноос олдсон бутач хүүхэд зэргээр нэрлэх байх л даа. Өө бас муу тоглох ёсгүй шигээ сайн тоглож бас болохгүй шүү. Хэрвээ чамайг сайн тоглоод эхэлбэл эсрэг багийнхан чинь чамайг хууран мэхлэгч, залилагчаар чинь дуудаж эхэлнэ. Бас тэдэнтэй хэрэлдэх гэвэл мөн л ээжийнхээ талаарх чихэнд чимэггүй нууцуудыг олж мэднэ. Тэгээд дараагаар нь тэд чамайг залилагч байна гэсэн шийдвэр дээрээ бат гэгч нь зогсоод ЦОРГо компани руу мэдэгдэл явуулна шүү хэмээн сүрдүүлж эхэлнэ.

headless_cyborg,True,"The Counter-Strike series is from long term perspective one of the best in FPS genre. Global Offensive improves already proven gameplay mechanics, keeps adding new features and it's one of the best first person shooter games ever made. Perfect optimalization, nice graphics and excellent gameplay. Counter-Strike is one of the few games that ignore today's console-like elements like auto-heal and the player has to think and focus to get the objective done instead of simple ""run and gun (and die)"". That's why is CS sometimes called ""a chess with guns"". CSGO is the best multiplayer first-person shooter I've ever played. Yes, the community is often horrible but fortunately it's possible to meet nice people as well. I've played more than 1000 hours (100% on Linux) and I didn't have a single crash or anything like that. So much fun, so many memories, so many nights spent playing with my friends.

Zackbare,False,"Amazingly enough, this game keeps making you more and more furious about how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ it is. It starts with hackers, a lot of them, so much so that until you cross the silver barrier, the servers will be crawling with hackers. Second is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ servers, they're soo bad sometimes that neither you or the opposite team are able to play and both teams keep spamming the chat with rage comments on ♥♥♥♥♥♥ srevers, now with panorama you cannot even report servers if they're ♥♥♥♥♥♥, taking it to a whole new level. Third, worst updates possible, I don't get it if they're trying to fix the game with updates or ruin it, specially with the latest 'PANORAMA' update which has crippled everyone's performance, whether it be ping, loss or fps, everything is just went downhill since then. Fourth, worst customer support, REMEMBER, if you're facing an issue with the game, ITS YOUR ♥♥♥♥♥♥ HARDWARE AND YOUR ♥♥♥♥♥♥ INTERNET, NOT THE VALVE, THEY'RE PERFECT. They literally take the apple approach to performance issues with the game, instead of helping you optimize the game, they'll recommend going to a technician to help optimize the game and spend money there, coz the money YOU give to buy the game doesn't include tech support. Fifth, though this can be included in performance issue, but there's times when the game will straight up freeze upon seeing an enemy or wont register hits even if you empty the whole magzine on their faces. Only get the game if it is a gift or it's on sale, it doesn't worth the full price. Review update: Right after I wrote the review I got ""some"" hacks which would help me aim and wall. And played till I got VAC ban which is for 250hrs and going from SEM to LEM, being a waller myself, I can gaurantee upon that atleast 50% people have vision assist of some kind and atleast 30% have some kind of trigger/aim assist. I wanted to prove that anyone can hack easily in this game, even with free hacks, which I used and can play for longer periods of time undetected. I got overwatch ban just because I got bored of it and started raging, if it weren't for that I could have reached to GE very easily."

D3fyant,False,"First Off...  Im not sure when Trolls, Smurfs, and Hacks began to become the norm, but the game is broken. They put it on sale for 5.00. Kids buy it just to hack it. Valve knows, they dont care. And all we do is BUY BUY BUY skins. I mean 400.00 for a knife skin? WTF?!??!!? Didnt we used to be able to get those for free?  The guys hacking have a customer service number to call if they cant set it up correctly. Hacking is Big Business. They took 12 name tags from me, all because of 1 off-color gun name. Meanwhile, vulgarity far worse than my gun name, is allowed to cheat, troll, and make the game unplayable. Because its funny to watch people get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ And valve does nothing but put the game on sale. And kids, Rememer. When you tell ghame developers that your ok with paying 65.00 + 35 or 50 for the ""season pass"".  You set what the market will bear. Thus making games MORE expensive for us, and limiting how much fun you can really have with it. Cuz if you cant afford the season pass.. you dont get all that content.  CSGO is setting an example of how to take all of your customers money, and make them happy they did it. Maybe they put it on sale so that you can afford to have 3 copies of they game. 1 for rank, 1 for smurfing, and 1 for hacking..."

SPEEDNUTTSTER,False,Seriously we bought game then you do these sh**  and when I queue for a game in cs go with my f2p friends i get so many hacks like seriously thanks valve first artifact then this woopdy doo what has come to you
FLAMBUOYANT,False,"I used to recommend this game but I can't anymore. CS:GO is broken in a number of important ways right now:  Pistols desperately need balance.  Netcode and servers are horrible. VAC essentially only catches the dumbest hackers.  Overwatch more or less an admission that VAC doesn't work well but is also useless.  Movement speed and run-and-gun gameplay style completely at odds with theme of tactical shooter.  Tapping often offers little reward for risk in current spray meta (exception being AK at distance). Jumping accuracy? ... Really? Why encourage jumping in a tactical shooter? SWEET REPLAYS!!! R8 revolver... feels like an April fool's joke that never ended and now is just sort of a troll gun. Non-Prime matchmaking a huge deterrent to new players - testing ground for hackers now.  Prime matchmaking seems like an awkward fix to broken VAC and honestly still plenty of walls/etc. Smokes still frequently glitch allowing players on one side to see through them. I won't list toxic community as a negative of the game because there's nothing the developer can do about that. For all of you who want to cite Riot Games' efforts to improve player behaviour ask yourself this one question: have their efforts worked? No. League of Legends has the most toxic player environment I've experienced even compared to CS:GO or Dota2. Competitive games bring out the worst in a lot of people. That's a people problem not a developer problem.  Anyway, in its current form I would not say that spending the considerable time to become skilled at this game is worth it as you will constantly be let down by wonky mechanics, bad servers, and the inescapable reality that there is a constant ebb and flow of hackers in competitive that make any sense of true competition feel absent.  All in all, CSGO will have you asking yourself: am I having fun or is this actually adding negativity and stress to my life? The answer will vary from game to game but in the long run I think most people play this game out of habit rather than having a consistently positive experience."

moxy,True,good
hot boy,True,"Get this game. This is one of my favorite games of all time, definitely my favorite fps ever, csgo is an online 5v5 competitive shooter where you play as both counter-terrorists and terrorists in a 30 round match. There are two major game modes with plenty of unique and memorable maps for you to play and improve on. Csgo does this amazing thing where you play it and you are completely awful at the game. Unlike COD, it has no mercy for those who can not get the fundamentals of the game down, the main 5 being movement, aiming, shooting, map knowledge and team work. This game has such a huge skill gap between the new players and the experienced players to where it can be intimidating for new players to try and play; however, the game has a great balance with their weapons to where new players can use weapons that require relatively lower skill to use and the old players can use the more challenging weapons to master, making it to where everyone can enjoy the game. The game is hyper-focused on how well a individual can do and it is a great thing. Not even mentioning the amazing teamwork possibilities. Put in the time in this game and you will learn a lot about yourself and skills you can apply in real life which is something very few games can do. However the game is not a perfect game, yet it comes close. Now before I criticize the game I just want to state that I own this game over 5 accounts with over 2,500 hours clocked online. I have a very good understanding of this game at the highest levels (non pro, rank G/A) on 3rd party platforms such as esea and faceit and I have climbed to the very top of the ranks on Valve's matchmaking. With thousands of games played over years of playing I can confidently say that I have legitimate grounds to review this game on. - MASSIVE CHEATING PROBLEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Around the rank DMG you will notice an massive increase in cheaters and at that rank and above there is not a single game you will play where there is not a cheater. - A good player with good aim will realize that the shot registration can be odd at times, even watching professional level games on 128 tick servers and 0 ping, the shot registration will simply not work - A good player can NOT carry for victory, one player can lose the game for you, but a good one can't win it for you - There are just several blatant visual draw distance issues on several maps which is kind of annoying and unacceptable for a game in 2018 with this big of a player base - Jumping is very inconsistent, bopping is not viable because of this which is fine because the game isn't focused around this and you can go to the community servers to bhop. Where the problem arises is when you want to throw a smoke that requires a jump, and it is inconsistent without a macro and macros can be considered cheating  - In my opinion, some of the guns need major buffs and nerfs, especially the under-used weapons and pistols. - There is a complete lack of tutorial for this game vs. games like quake live, so it makes it harder for new players to enjoy the game which hurts the game if new players lose interest because of the difficulty - Most of the casual game modes are just boring and the big operations are scarce - Skins in the game are blatantly overpriced and the odds of getting anything you want from cases are so slim that it is a waste of money - The updates to the maps feel like they are lowering the skill level for movement which is very disappointing for players who put a lot of practice into their movement - Prime requires you to be level 21 - No unranked matchmaking - The cooldown system has a lot of issues that could easily be fixed - The replay system is awfully slow  - Overwatch is accessible for low ranked players which is the single most idiotic thing I have ever heard of. It is obviously not a good idea to give the ability to ban players to people who can't get past gold nova, I have gotten overwatch banned before because of this and it is really not fun being banned because some gold nova 3 thought you were cheating. - Low tick rate servers Those are just my main gripes with the game, but honestly even with those flaws the game is still one of my favorites, an easy 10/10 for me as this game has taught me a lot of skills I can apply in other fps games, but more importantly I learned a lot about teamwork, my mentality to playing competitively and learning from other players who are just better and dealing with the reality of my own ego while reaching the highest ranks the game has to offer. It is truly an experience I will never get from any other game; this is the game that has ruined all other games for me for a very long time until recently I was able to put it down. It is a game I can always come back to and enjoy every time and I already know within the next year I might inspire myself to push even further than what I thought was possible skill wise, but until then I will enjoy the game casually. Thank you to the people who actually take their time to read this."
haru,True,Hate taking responsibility? Do you like to blame others for your own mistakes? Then buy this game.
Lemon,True,"Extremely toxic community, you will be lucky to not have your whole team scream at you for missing one shot or being cursed for not being fast enough. Other than the cancerous community it's quite a nice game especially if you are playing with your friends and not some brain dead children who will try to find you by your IP address and try to murder you and your relatives for being not as good as them."
Ducky the Bee,True,"It is kind of hard to say I do not like the game after > 1100 hours of gameplay. It is very addictive!  What I love about the game is the fact that skill matters and that every player, from total noob to pro-level, has the same arsenal of guns to use. You can not get better guns or upgrades by investing money, meaning it is skill, experience and teamwork (and connection) that  makes the difference.  But you can give your guns a personal touch, by getting different skins, adding a personal name to a weapon and add stickers.   I really like the bomb defusal mode (or bomb placement when you are a terrorist), but there are also other game types: Hostage rescue, Armsrace , Deathmatch and Demolition.  Also there is a big library with player made map, all with their own rules and styles. (aim training, headshots only, all vs all, achievement maps, platformstyle and surfmaps)  This is my first ever FPS, so needed the first 1k hours (i am a very slow student) to learn how to hold a gun, how to recognize enemies and friends, learn game mechanics and map based tactics and to work well in a team, etc.   The overall crappy community is not making it easy to learn the game, because specially as a starting player you get kicked out of matches all the time.   Hey I am silver 1 (lowest competative ranking) , of course I am not a star player!  Many other players on that same level are hacking, have second accounts, or are experienced in other shooters.  And their patience level with newcomers is about 0.  So a mistake (even if i had no clue i made one) resulted often in an insta kick.  Most absurt thing was getting kicked out of a casual match for being noob...omg really?:)  If you can't practice in a  competative match, and get kicked out of casual matches too...then how on earth can you learn how to play?   Despite an overall crappy community, I met some awesome people. Lot of fun to play together, preferably in a full team, or just some casual matches, armsrace, deathmatch or training.  And training does pay off!  Anyway, you would think that by now I am a pro, but hell no! I guess I have to conclude I am not talented enough to get to a high rank. On the bright side....I do not get kicked out of a team anymore, at least not that often....must be doing something good! Still playing daily, and still loving it!   So... recommended?  Hell yeh!  NB I just have to mention that that laguage used ingame is really bad... Maybe thats just my feminine view., but I think it extremely childish and limited to the same scolding words over and over. Quite pathetic to be honest.  I  learned to ignore it.  Loving the mute button!  I just hope that it is not a reflection of those people irl. That would be really sad.

Edit: I stand corrected by fellow users on the prime status, it is enabled, however, it is being offered for purchase on the store page for some reason."
rytho,False,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive used to be a great game, but constant bad updates and the toxic playerbase have ruined it.  The competitive aspect used to seem like a good thing, but people take this game way too seriously and will lash out at you if you do anything even slightly wrong, and then on the other hand there are people who don't take it seriously enough and join competitive games just to annoy the people who take it seriously. There is no balance to this, you will hardly ever find a good team that you enjoy playing with. Maps - There may seem like a decent selection of maps to choose from, but there are only a select few which actually get played, and those are the old maps which most people have played thousands of times so it may be hard to get into, you may even feel discouraged. Not P2W - This game isn't pay to win, there are only weapon/glove skins which are purely cosmetic or different knives which ultimately all do the same thing, there has been a lot of controversy in the past about this kind of system being available to kids, there are cases where children steal their parents credit card just to buy skins. Many of the recent updates over the past year or so have been garbage, with many maps being added which almost never get played after a week, along with glove skins and other items so that valve can make money. I feel like this game has been abandoned by the developers, and now they primarily use it as another way to make easy money, completely disregarding the loyal playerbase and professional players. Smurfs (an experienced player using a new account to face lower ranks) and hackers are a pretty big problem in this game, and despite valves many failed attempts at combating the issue almost nothing has changed. Valves anti-cheat is garbage, and if you do end up getting this game, I would reccomend either faceit or ESEA, because their anti-cheat is a lot better and you generally face better players than if you were to play regular competitive. Although this game used to be a lot of fun to play competitively with friends, I can not reccomend it in it's current state, in my eyes this game is dying and after putting just over 1000 hours into it, I am ready to never play it again. Feel free to comment on anything you disagree with :)"

Sermike,True,"Review: Counter Strike: Global Offensive Gameplay: The Game mechanics are in my opinion pretty simple yet extremely effective. Aiming feels almost flawless, no weapons are overpowered if you have enough experience. Game isnt really trying to be realistic. Its more of a skillset shooter (Spraypatterns, prefire common spots, when to use each weapon, economy and blah blah blah 1 taps) CS:GO has multiple mods and community servers which shows this isnt a comp. oriented shooter. Multiplayer: Sadly there is the problem. As we all know VAC isnt the smartest anti-cheat system which means you will play against some fishy players (Wh, Aim, 2000$ gaming chair). Only way to really get past this problem is my using ESEA or another 3rd party client (Never used sadly) which needs a monthly fee probably. Other than that the game is pretty fun. Community: The Community is pretty Toxic as it is in almost every Competitive Multiplayer game. There are obviously some mature players but not everyone is. 1 good aspect is that you can learn to swear in 81 different languages. (malaka, cy ka bly at, kur wa, ich fick deine mutter, youre g ay, blo ody bas tard, kardashian) some examples. Graphics: Game looks ok for a 2004 source engine.  Nothing amazing. Performance: Runs on a German Potato like a charm. Price: Its cheap but i personally would pay a premium price for less cheaters. Recommended if you want to die because of cancer."

Komomo,True,"The spiritual successor to ""The Secret of Monkey Island™"" (titled cs:go) is one of my personal favourite point and click adventures of all time; wether it's the engaging puzzles or intricate story, this game is always sure to provide hours upon hours of family friendly fun. the game's premise is that you're either a ""CT"" or a ""Counter-Troublemaker"" who's job is to stop the ""T's"" or ""Troublemaker's"" shenanigans, such as graffiti, egging houses, or the such. All these are of course now animated, comparative to the simplicity of  ""The Secret of Monkey Island™"". All in all, a great game and tons of fun. But it's kind of a rough port, and i'd reccomend purchase on ps3.  8/10"

bungalomaster,False,"I can remember the days when playing this game was actually fun. Now, it simply is not. Not just in Silver league, where people either troll constantly even if you're top fragging and you're the only one actually trying, hacking or smurfing from much higher ranks. Every game makes me angry. I play against LEM smurfs, Globals smurfs, even the good ol' Silver Elite Master smurfs who still manage to destroy everyone. I spoke with some Globals and they all decided to smurf because the game became unplayable. Too many hackers trying to be bette than everyone else. The same can be said for every other tier. It is nothing short of PATHETIC. Don't get me wrong, I learned my lesson after getting VACed a long time ago, and now I'm part of the suffering demographic of the CS:GO community. Every game I get trolled. Every game I get annihilated by players who belong in much higher tiers but still enjoy destroying the players who still need to practise giving accurate callouts. Nothing I have said so far has been hyperbolized, this is actually how the game is now. Hackers not getting banned. Smurfs having fun wreaking havoc and trolls jumping in front of you every time you shoot so you kill them and get kicked. These low-lives even gang up on you once they know you're getting angry. Next thing you know you're being body blocked all over the place and the only thing you can do is beg for a kick. I don't even have 200 hours on this account yet and the past 20-30 have been nothing but the same puerile crap. 30 year old adults acting like babies. At least the 12 year olds, even with the squeaky voices and diametrical tempers, actually try to win. Every time I log on, I have a positive mindset and feel like both having fun and winning. Then I meet the 3 types of players I just talked about. Not to mention that after the game is over, you're glad because you get the part ways and play another game with other players that won't give you a hard time. Oh wait, no you don't. You get matched up with the very same players over and over again unless you take a 20 minute break to ensure that you truly meet other players. And the cycle continues. This is not fun. If you already have the game, can't say anything you don't already know and agree with.  If you're looking to buy it, don't. Go play some games that are actually worth your time. Don't think for a second you'll get the same games and players you see on the pro players' videos on youtube, because you sure as hell will not.  This game is no longer enjoyable. I know that I am bad and that's why I'm not Gold Nova let alone Silver 3. But at least I actually try to play the game, to communicate and teach the basics to the ones that are new to this game. How many reports have I sent out for griefing? And how many have been dealt with? I'm more than confident that the answer is not a single one.  Buy the game if you want, I obviously can't stop you. But think it through. Do you want to spend 16 bucks for hours of just being constantly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off?"

ジッケムル,True,"Hi im JokemL, and im a CS:GO player. I have played over 1500 hours over multiple accounts. And I have now decided to write a little review. I can't remember that much from when I first got the game, but it went something like this: Play one game-quit-next day-play one game-quit, and that went on for a little while. Now that I am a little older and know the game better then I did for just 4-5 years ago, I can tell you what I like and dislike about this game. Starting with what I like about this game: I like that there is a solid community around the game, though there is alot of scammers/hackers/others, but there is always someone kind just around the corner. When I started playing CS I liked the pistols on CT cause I felt like I was in the police force. I also liked the AWP and the Ak-47 cause of the insane damage I got with it. I didn't really use the other guns, but other people played good with it. The game felt really good at the start and I was ready to be a pro. Getting a rank wasn't so big for me at that time, only playing Deathmatch or Gun Game most of the time. I can't even remember my first ever rank. My tips to new players: Don't care about what rank you get. Start with having fun and playing on your own level. After watching alot of videos of how to get better and how to improve this and that, I started playing more serious. Changing my settings to what the pros have, Using other crosshairs and viewmodels and such. I started playing better and doing better on the scoreboard. I started warming up everyday to keep me on the level I was. Playing with friends that have good game sence and a microphones and having good communication was the key to a better experience and a happy rankup. Youtubers that posts tips and tricks:  And there is alot more people that posts tips and tricks. What I dislike about the game:  Starting with Hackers. There is always going to be some kind of cheaters in CS and that it's hard for valve to ban them all, but I think they could do better. The amount of hackers I meet on a daily bases is just insane, example wingman. In wingman there is atleast one hacker in 1-3 matches, and I have reported so many of them and up to 20% of they have been banned but up to 80% of they still allowed to play on valve secured servers. This is a problem. Toxic. You may have heard the word toxic before, you may even be toxic. There is alot of players that are toxic, saying bad words to you, been hateful against you, telling you that you are bad and things like that. This is a problem that will never be solved, just because of how many plays the game and how many people that gets mad if someone is bad or you losing a game.  Toxic players is hard to deal with and you have to either mute him or just try to talk to him in a normal way. Scammers. Scammers is also a thing that ruins the game for most people. To lose alot of money because of a scammer is not the most fun thing on this planet. it has happened to me aswell, loseing over $200 cause of a scam is not fun at all. Thats why you always should double check every trade you do. (Don't trust people over the internet) I love operations, but it takes so long before the next operation, so we just sit and wait for over 1 year... This is something that makes me a little angry. CS is the same over and over again and that is not a bad thing, but we would love to sit back and relax with a operation. Overall I like this game and I think you would like it aswell. Thanks.

Farre,True,"The basic concept of competive Counter-Strike match has changed very little in the past 17 years:  5 terrorists and 5 counter-terrorists fight each other in order to detonate/defuse bomb or eliminate  entire enemy team to win. Same old story but everything is polished to a perfection. You usually find a competive match within a minute and game is ready to start usually within 5 minutes. When playing other game modes a game is usually ready for you almost instantly. CS:GO servers are really stable and I have never experienced a server or game crash. If one players happens to quit/drop/crash player is automatically replaced by a computer controlled bot. This is a great improvement as one or even two players quiting no longer means 100% sure lost. There are multiple gaming modes available and while most people play just competive I strongly suggest atleast trying Arms race and demoliton modes. They offer far more easy going, less stressful and quicker game sessions. Counter-strike has always been all about teamplay. Playing competive is almost pointless without a microphone which is the best way to discuss with other teammates. Typing with keyboard is not good enough because gameplay is so fast-paced. You get most out of this game when you are playing with friends. Most of the CS:GO community seems to be younglings and that means there will be a lot of swearing, bullying, insulting and bad sense of humor. Pretty much in every single game with strangers. I have played Counter-Strike since 1999 and playing CS has never been as easy & smooth as it is today with CS:GO. Easy to learn for people new to fps games and hard to master even for fps veterans. [HISTORY LESSON] Just to point out how easy competive match making is made in CS:go, I tell you how you found a competive match in early 2000's: First you had to gather 5 friends to play (sometimes you had to wait like an hour before you could find all the players, because everyone had to be part of the same clan/team,  you couldn't play with strangers). After that you had to go to a specific IRC chat channel to find your opponents (5 mins if you had a server of your own, up to an hour if you didn't). Then you confirmed the match with your opponents at Clanbase (A site that keep track with clans/teams wins and losses). Finally everything was set for all players to manually connect the game server. Use console command to start recording your gameplay (in order to proof after the game that you are were not cheating) and start playing. After the match upload your gameplay records to clanbase and pray that your opponents are kind enough to confirm the correct game score as soon as possbile in order to receive points from winning. [/history lesson] 10 - Perfect game 9 - Excelent game, best of the genre 7 - Average game, nothing really special 6 - Bad game, avoid 5 - Painful to play, completely waste of time 4 - Failed game, unpayable"

CyDoN,False,"I had a lot of fun some years back in the 2012-2014 reaching the rank of Supreme mostly playing with friends but also as solo. I came back this year to try the game again after some absence from the scene.  WTF has happened?  This game has the worst community possible, it antagonizes the one that LoL has but I guess here things are worse. If you don't speak Russian you are doomed to play in competitive servers with people that don't speak English at all in about 80% of your matches, these guys use the VOIP system to speak Russian even if they are just 2 out the 5 players in your team, their only communication is shooting you or try to kick you if they think you do something wrong. DON'T GET ME WRONG HERE I have a lot of Russian friends through other games and they are really nice people. Apart from the Russians another portion of the community is immature people, they go harsh on teammates, bash them, trolling them and in generally trying to prove something, these disputes in many cases end up with the player being either the attacker or the defender leaving the game or getting banned for friendly fire, about 80% of the times you play you will end up playing a 4vs5 Match (at least in my DMG and LE levels that I played this year). This is a team game, you can't win by yourself but most people don't get it. If you reach a higher level of skill it doesn't mean that you are also a good player in terms of tactics and strategies. Another negative thing is the 64tick rate servers that the competitive system uses, I believe this is set to allow distant players to have a decent ping and/or to save resources for the servers. This thing ruins the game too, it makes aiming really funny, you will understand If you ever go on a LAN server or play on a 128 tick rate server, this will result into playing a totally different game. The way the rates work now is that the attacking player has always the advantage as prefiring won't leave the defender time to react. There is huge but in all this: Are you willing to pay a subscription? If you have 4 dedicated friends to play the game with I guarantee you that you will have an excellent time if you decide to go play somewhere where you pay to play like ESEA and FACEIT with a better community. There you will find descent people that value their money and are willing to play in a higher level without having to take all this *love* mentioned above. This review is written in frustration after playing 5 consecutive 4vs5 games only with non englsh-speaking teammates. And this scenario this year doesn't happen for the first time."

ThreuM,False,"The review you are about to read is alot of mixed feelings.. Notice i have 3k+ hours.. I have been playing Counter-Strike since 1.5 with some breaks in between focusing on school or relationships and while i have played plenty of other big titles growing up such as the Grand Theft Auto series or the Battlefield series i have always come back to the one game that i know and love. If you are really into shooters and have tried this game than you too will probably agree that CS has the most consistent replayability factor and is arguably the simplest yet most skillful shooter out there. Unlike games like Call Of Duty or Battlefield there is little to no debris covering your screen or random hiding spots that people camp behind at all times. Yes it happens but to be good in Counter-Strike Global Offensive you must capitalize on rushes and support your teammates in completing the objective. This is the ULTIMATE teamplay game and has just recently had an incredible boost in professional cs go tournaments concerning prize money and the viewers watching them. I stayed up all night til 7am to watch either Dreamhack or ESL (forget which one) That one match alone had about 300,000 viewers.. whereas CS Source was barely keeping their head above water with Professional tournys and teams in their day. So whats the problem?? The up until just recently awesome people over at Valve have become so focused on aqcuiring new players and revenue reguarding things like skins, cases, keys, taxes on items we sell on the marketplace, passes for new maps with objectives and even new copies of the game. Somewhere along the way i feel as if they have given up on the integrity of the game because it seems like every few months they put the game on sale for 5 bucks or so even though it is already insanely cheap only $15. I dont think you will find a single player in CS that will tell you they have played another game that is better or even EQUAL to CS and its replayability for $15.. That being said over time of course people will accuse other people of hacking i.e. wallhacking/aimbotting so if the game goes on sale for 4.99 even if a percentage of the people accusing others of hacking buy the game cheap just to have an alt account to get revenge and also hack thats a problem.. Now you think about Valve putting the game on sale a couple times a year and of course there will be MANY people that buy 5 or even more copies of the game! ..Just to hack and boost their friends.. This is becoming more of a problem for legit players like me. I literally feel like a superhero in a world full of villians. I am quickly seeing the decline of great real fun real skilled matches in CSGO. Everytime i join a competitive match there will from now on ALWAYS be a new account on the other team.. What is their excuse? ""Oh im just smurfing.."" You can even tell there are many more people hacking in overwatch these days. (overwatch is a self review cs go system of random people to determine if they were hacking or not) 6-12 months ago you would find overview cases kind of a challenge to decide on and most of the time would have some pretty nice skins. Nowadays 9/10 Overwatch cases they have absolutely no skins on their account or .20 cent skins to make it look like they do have skins and they couldnt POSSIBLY be hacking. Hackers do this because they KNOW there is a very high chance of them getting banned and losing these skins forever. Valve states that anyone Vac-Banned will NOT be able to get it overturned for any reason whatsoever. So tell me why during one of the major CS GO tournaments that just passed Pasha from the pro team Virtus Pro he was being filmed in real life over his shoulder and got vac banned in the middle of his match. simply said no i am not hacking and got his account UNBANNED. If he was at a lan tourny with everyone watching then he couldnt have been hacking right?? Wrong. It is going around that there is an undectable and unseen hack that is built into the map from the workshop(not exactly certain on the details) even when you are watching his screen in real life you would not notice.. Even worse than that every time valve does a wave of vac bans which is not nearly often enough there comes another undetectable hack that people find almost right away. The major point i am trying to make on this subject is that Valve makes MILLIONS on us for each skin, key, case, tax on the items we sell in game, operation pass and copy of the game we buy. and they still have a mediocre anti cheat system.. thats like the NFL making billions of dollars and letting anyone onto the field during the game because as long as they have a football jersey on they wont get caught. If you ask me they are stealing our money and are completely content with people buying 1,2,3, 10 new copies of the game with their excuse being ""smurfing"" (smurfing is when you log into a diff account with a much lower rank and completely destroy the other team to have   It's pathetic and lowers Counter-Strike dramatically in my eyes as the greatest competitive game ever on PC. We must not forget it did pave the way for games like COD. Valve needs to stop being content with the $$$$ they are raking in and take back the integrity of the game. If that means hiring a whole new department to look into this and take serious action then so be it but for now if a friend just got a pc and asked what game he should download i would NOT recommend Counter-Strike.. Again i have been playing for about a decade and i myself come close to stopping playing all together sometimes sadly i am so attached to CS its not something i can easily do. Valve knows this and Valve is taking advantage of us. END OF STORY."

I realised something when i was playing one day, the game has gone trough a lot of changes and that it was slowly turning into a moba like game, where rank is more importand than having fun. How valve changed CS for me made me yonder and ponder from the time when i was playing  CS 1.6 or CSS. Back then there where no rankings nor matchmaking and the  servers  where flooded with ads. I really hate how people neglect the times when people were fun to play with. Now people only care about how big your rank is, and how expensive your skins are. Where are the good old times? To me this game is a mess because of the ranking system and i mustn't  recommend it for players from CS 1.6 OR CSS.

Green,True,"Whether you're a casual FPS gamer or a very competitive hard-core player, CS:GO is where it's at.   A large variety of game modes from frantic action to tactical matches that rely on strategy as heavily as skill give this title plenty of value.  There is no single player campaign, though playing with bots is always an option.  CS:GO's highly polished gameplay and graphics that look fine without being too flashy let you concentrate on playing a game rather than crazy visuals.  It can't be understated that the HUD stays very clean unlike most modern shooters (Battlefield and COD, I'm looking at you!). Unlike previous CS titles, GO includes a weapon drop system similar to DOTA 2 or TF2 but all weapons are skins and merely for aesthetics.  You can actually sell your free weapon drops on the Steam market if you're lucky!  I've personally made $30 steam bucks so far.  For competitive gamers, CS:GO is one of the largest Esports in the world (and THE largest FPS).  The DreamHack Winter 2013 tournament featured a prize pool of $250,000!  It's easy to get started because there is a great in-game Competitive matchmaker that throws together teams of 5v5.  With any internet game, you're going to meet some jerks, but I've had a great experience with the matchmaker and have made a lot of Steam friends that have taught me a lot.  Don't be discouraged by the learning curve.  With great effort, comes great rewards!  Now GO buy it!!"

Whuster,True,Its okay
Reanimate,True,"CS:GO is a world famous FPS known for its intense, unique, and deep gameplay and its strong presence in the eSports scene. It's also the game that, at the time of writing this review, I have put the most hours into. It's so addicting, and if you find the right team to play with that communicates and strategizes, is an absolute blast and one of the best FPS games I have ever played. Despite all the toxicity associated with the game, CSGO is still a great game in my eyes. It's a unique FPS that I will happily play for many more hours to come so I can hone my skills and become a dominant player. I decided to archive my old review. It's only a picture because of how short it is."

Bought some games with some of the guns i got, i sold and kept a few of the guns i won from the bets. Went online owned with the guns i got from the bets. Had beggers asking for guns. Told them to 'F**k off squeeky c*unts"". Got banned online for a week cause my tea was ready and i couldnt be botherd eating cold mash and and sausages so i exited the game.

Deak Sauce,False,The Game is more worried about making $$$ and making skins which in turn = more $$$. Then getting rid of the cheaters and people that exploit the game. The only thing that was remotely fun about the game was the skin trading. You could get some skins then trade them up and sometimes get a skin worth enough $$$ to sell on the steam market to buy a new game. But now if you start with a 2-3$ skin and you want to trade your way up to a knife or another skin it will take years only being able to trade a skin every 7 days. RIP any fun left in this game

Spaced,True,Worse than a meth addiction
Scootie,True,"Note: This is a temporary review, I'm still pretty new to the game so I'll write another one when I invest/waste more hours on it -My First Game I remember it really well, because it was a game that summed up CSGO almost perfectly. Dust 2, a micspammer named ""Martin Shkreli"" playing MLP at earrape volume, 12 year olds on the mic and no strategy apart from ""Rush B"". I had no idea what I was doing, no idea about what weapons were good and bad and most importantly no idea how spray control functioned. Not surprisingly I went 1 and 13, or something like that. -Gamemodes Casual is more or less a big amount of players running around with no evident strategy apart from the goal to get a good KD ratio. 60% of the time Dust 2, 30% Mirage and 10% another map such as Cache or Cobblestone. However these maps you most likely will play in Competitive, so you can sharpen your ""skills"" and map knowledge here pretty easily. Competitive can be amazing, and it can be terrible. It all depends on how good your team is, and how good the opposing team is. I strongly recommend you play with at least one friend who is at a similar skill level to yourself so you don't get a team full of bogans/russians/idiots/whatever. If I solo queue my team will look something like this (at it's worst, some solo queue games can be cool): Me American guy who calls strats but nobody listens Angry Australian guy who yells through his mic when we lose Another guy who never talks or communicates and has connection issues Someone half decent at the game but gets irritated with his team OR a 12vie Other team: Uber Smurf Someone terrible at the game but gets carried by good teamies Someone in a party Someone else in the same party who says ""ez"" every time they win a round Anime Enthusiast who always runs AWP and Scout Uh, I haven't actually tried out any other gamemodes like Arms Race and Deathmatch, but from YouTube they look pretty cool.  -Weapons and Strategy, Silver Style. Terrorists (assuming they win each round) -Round One: Tec 9 Rush B♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Idi Nahui -Round Two: Some SMG  -Round Three: AKs -Round Four and onwards: Someone buys an AWP, rest buy AKs and Armor Counter Terrorists (assuming they win each round) -Round One: Five Seven or Armor plus Decoy -Round Two: Some SMG -Round Three: P90 or M4/M4A1-S -Round Four and onwards: Someone buys an AWP, rest buy M4/M4A1-S or P90 and Armor Eco Round? Doesn't exist in low Silver xD Save? Doesn't really happen Strategy? ""B"", ""Rush B ♥♥♥♥♥"", ""Long A"", ""Short A"", ""A split"" and that's about it. You WILL get yelled at if you use the Autosnipers, P90, camp with an AWP or ""accidentally"" teamkill. -Rank up System CS:GO has 2 rank systems, one for the whole game in which you get random items drops when you level up and one that is only applicable in Competitive which determines the skill level of players you will play with/against. Having a separate rank system for Competitive is a great idea, as it encourages players to play more and work as a team. However this can be abused, and Valve can't really do anything about it. -Smurfing A ""smurf"" is basically someone who is reasonably experienced at the game and  creates/buys an alt account to play against others who have a lower skill level. You can detect smurfs by looking at their steam profiles, if they have few friends, low hours in other games etc.  If you manage to kill a smurf, rub it in their face. You killed someone who most likely has a far higher skill ceiling than you did, and tilting them is a perfect way to get them mad and not thinking logically. Sure its a dirty tactic, but who really cares in this game. -VAC System/Overwatch Yeah not much of an expert on this one, since I can't really detect subtle hackers etc. However I think it's a little better than the TF2 VAC system, since players in the community can review evidence sent to them (if they have Overwatch) and make the decision. -Community I've heard many times that the CS:GO community is ""toxic"" and ""cancer"" because of the people that play the game. It's true, if you play this game you WILL meet horrible and mean people who sweat and scream when they die. But thats what makes CS:GO stand out from other games, it's much more than a game for millions of players. Many people basically spend all their time playing this game, and I don't blame them. Personally I can't get bored of this game, there is always something new you can do. Without the ""toxic"" community CS:GO probably would not drag in as many players as it has currently, but that's just my opinion. In game the community is very vocal, with about half the players using a mic to yell/call strats/communicate (good or bad?). -Stereotypical CS:GO players in Australia/NZ ""Sweaty Nerds"" who play basically nonstop Unmarried Adult Males who yell at their teammates- ""Yo, this guy is literally a 20 year old male!"" Guys who pretend to be girls with their profile pics but you realize they're not :/ Cuties and Hotties (right here) Rich Kiddies who spend money on skins to look sexy but they suck at the game (here again...) Australian Bogans (basically Russians here) Anime Profile Pic who is really good at the game People with no skins that do really well  12vie micspammers...jeez there a lot of them Grill Gamers People who add you because of your skins and make crazy offers for them -YouTube presence/MLG CS:GO There are a TON of amazing CS:GO YouTubers out there. I recommend you check out WarOwl, MojoOnPC, Sparkles, Nick Bunyun, 3kliksPhillip etc. The tutorials can be pretty helpful, and give you some game sense.  I know NOTHING about MLG CS:GO but it seems pretty big. I basically chose a team at random, Envyus, and supported them. PashaBiceps will always be my favorite player though, since he balances out his time spend gaming with exersize to keep fit. -CS:GO Skins and Cases I've already spent around 450 dollars to buy the skins I want. Hey, it's better than wasting thousands gambling away money to dodgy websites. Also I wouldn't recommend unboxing CS:GO Cases, as you should just buy off the Community Market and not rely on luck to make unlikely profit. However if you have money you want to waste unbox away and pray for a knife/glove. -Valve/Game Developers Eh, I've seen many reviews saying that ""CS:GO is dying/Valve pays no attention to the game anymore/OMG Valve is ditching us for Dota!!"" and this possibly could be true. Valve just wants money, like any business would. However I don't really any need for Valve to do much more than make sure the game is balanced and running correctly (Unlike TF2 which has a 5 man development team). Note again that this is just my current opinion, since I'm still a newbie to the game. -Friendly Aspect to the game? Knife fights mid don't really count, and the only friendly game I played was on Cache with people spraying♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on the wall. I left that one, what a surprise. CS:GO is a VERY competitive game, so I wouldn't reccomend going friendly as you'll most likely get killed and kicked. Stick to Hightower. -Overall Opinion It's an amazingly good game, it could do with a little bit more attention from Valve but has a huge player base (constantly second most played on steam) and will not ""die"" anytime soon. The community is very...diverse...but don't take anything mean they say seriously and you should be gucci okay :) The game is played across the globe, hence the name GLOBAL offensive and will be for many years to come.  Dayum, that was a LONG review, its just that CS:GO has so much in it to cover. It's pretty good."

Neo Jack,True,"It's important to appreciate games like this for what they are, and this game is a callback to a past chapter of video game history that's been buffed and polished. And unfortunately as someone who never actually played the original Counter-Strike games, I'm not in much of a position to judge exactly how well they pulled this off. Basically, it entirely boils down to the kind of person you are. If you're a die-hard Counter-Strike fan, then this is probably all you can ask for. If you're a more typical gamer who just finished playing Crysis or Battlefield and wants to pick up something to play over the weekend, then trust me when I say that this is NOT the game for you. It's the online FPS equivilent of Dark Souls, in a way."

Browski21,False,the battle royal mode just seems like a gimic to follow the band wagon of battle royal and they pretty much screwed over the people who actually perchased this game by making it free at least warn us before we buy it and now it seems there are more hackers thanks valve.
App1ns,False,"Sure it's fun, at first. The game goes from fun to frustrating quickly, the gameplay is rather simple, but that's not the problem. Don't expect a game that is fun at first, also don't expect the game to be fun at all. The problem is how bad competitivie is, it's more fun to do homework than it is to play a game of competitive against a hacker. It doesn't help that the game is only fun less than 50% of the time Invest your time in something else than this sinkhole. Learn how to code or just do your homework, you will have a better time and you will be more happy in the long run. You shouldn't have to invest 500 hours+ into a game for it to start being fun"
Cat on Linux,False,"boring, basically bare bone shooter on same maps. The only variety you can get is with skins for your guns (and I suspect that's the only reason why CS:GO community is still alive). Even after 2000000 hours of gameplay you will be on same map doing same ""mission"" with same guns and same 10 y.o. kids who can't keep their mouths shut. In 10 minutes of the match you'll hear their ""stories of life"", lots of strong language with poor accent and there's no hope to enjoy this utterly boring thing. I've got it on sale with -50% off and I feel robbed, This game by content and by gameplay is worse than any indie game under 5 dollars."

ChuckNorris(,False,"This review comes from a man who played cs 1.6 for years and more than 600hours on CS:GO. This game is a fun game ONLY if you play with a group, ideally of 5 people. Otherwise, this game is UTTER GARBAGE. The matchmaking is so broken that I can't even describe it. Even if it might seem balanced, you only get to play a ""balanced"" game 1 every 20-30 games, and even then there's a pretty high chance you'll end up with one of the following people: a retard, a russian who doesn't speak english, a troll, a hacker. The rest of the games are either 16:1 in your favor, or 1:16 against you. And trust me, the ones you lose with scores like 10:16 are the worst games, cause this game TRULY gets the best out of you. For instance, if you play for about 3 hours CS, you'll need around 4 to let the tension this game creates blow off. It's unreal! If I have to spend time in online multiplayer games, it will definitely not be CS:GO, LOL, DOTA2 and other multiplayer teamgames, cause the community and the vast majority of the playerpool (around 80%) IS GARBAGE."

Fresh Matt,True,"This is an extremely mixed and short review. I think the game has cool and original gameplay. Though it doesn't highly innovate, it stills maintains the Counter-Strike gameplay that has been going on for about 15 years.  Let's talk about the community. About 5% of the people you meet on Global Offensive are really nice people. 95% think they're MLG♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and WILL kick you if you're not very good. I've been kicked multiple times and it feels awful, to think that people don't want you on your team. Makes my stomach drop to the bottomless pit. Seriously, beware of the abysmal community and stick with your friends. If you work together with your friends to prevent the opposing team from winning, you'll have a much better time than you would being John Rambo. But now I'm going to say this is an amazing game and I totally recommend playing it if you like competetive, slow-paced games then play with a group of friends, you'll have fun."

segfault,False,"If you join a pub server and scroll through the players you'll probably find at least one more or less blatant waller, and you can rest assured VAC isn't going to detect their tutorial copy paste cheats any time soon. You know it's bad when there's an actual business around providing a 3rd party matchmaking system where people don't cheat, and there's more than one competing platform.   Gun balance is what it is, it comes and goes with Valves seemingly random patches. Some changes the community agrees with, some it doesn't, not like the community can always even agree with itself. Pistols are stronger than I'd like, certainly stronger than in previous titles. Acceleration and player speed are quite quick, which sometimes leads to frustrating experiences with getting dicked on by a strafe spamming pistol player. Speaking of frustrating experiences, it's hard to blame Valve for the playerbase, but still I wish there was something to be done about it. Mostly matchmaking gives you cool teammates, but sometimes you face a tirade of rage and abuse without any recourse. I'm not sure the reports actually do anything. You could say there's a lot of customizability what with the cosmetics, skins and sprays and such. It's just that you used to be able to download them from fpsbanana but Valve has figured out a way to turn that into a revenue stream. Good for them, money sink for others. Granted, you don't need cosmetics but I think it's safe to say most like to have a few. I have mixed feelings. At it's core CS:GO is a solid competitive team FPS with a lot of gameplay depth, good map pool, active playerbase and lots to learn and room to improve yourself. There's just many little pitfalls. I think a lot of people will end up spending more time on this game than they initially expected. I don't know if I'd recommend it. You get really into it and then it just becomes too frustrating."
SMILE,False,HACKERS DOMINATE THIS GAME #FIXCSGO
Mateoski,False,"After several hours in this game, all I can say is that this game has the absolute worst community I have EVER SEEN in my entire life, and worse than Call of Duty's, Battlefield's, PAYDAY 2's, Team Fortress 2's, or Left 4 Dead's. CS:GO's community is the living embodiment of EVERYTHING that is wrong with the gaming community. You get insulted by either your teammates or the enemy team for EVERY little thing, on Casual, and ESPECIALLY in Competitive, and you can't mute them either because you have to somehow find some useful information that's buried underneath the childish and immature insults from these manchildren and kids that love talking♥♥♥♥♥♥because you can't physicallly punch them in the face in real life because of distance. The virginity, girlfriendless, sexism (I've seen really immature and horny ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that prey on girls, and I've also seen stupid, ♥♥♥♥♥♥, attention seeking girls on this game as well that bait guys), anti-social, fanboyism, nerdism, sociopathy, childishness, manchildishness, and immaturity are at maximum here in this game. Then there's these clutch or kick nerds that can't ever give you a ♥♥♥♥ing chance and are constantly pressuring you and cause you to fail, then they put up a votekick against you and kick you out for losing ONE round even though you're most likely leading and carrying the entire team, and winning the match as well, and it's worse if you're in a Competitive match when this happens because of the ♥♥♥♥ing cooldown system, which is another issue with this game. You can even get banned for votekicking too many players or get banned when it's not your fault (say the power goes out or your PC has to restart and are unable to make it back in time, or need to leave the match for something important in real life.) And that♥♥♥♥♥♥can last up to 1 hour to 7 damn days. Then there's these rank nerds (honestly the worst part about CS:GO) who love to belittle others (especially towards Silvers) because of their rank as if a ♥♥♥♥ing rank in a VIDEO GAME means something important in real life. If you want a rank that actually means something, then join the ♥♥♥♥ing military or the police, you know, REAL LIFE situations that actually MATTER. This game isn't very friendly to newcomers of the series either, as they also get insulted for not being good at a game they're NEW to and/or being a Silver rank. Again, join the ♥♥♥♥ing military or the ♥♥♥♥ing police if a rank matters so goddamn much to you. And let's not forget Community servers either, which are chock full of power-hungry and abusive badmins (one of the things ruining Battlefield 4), that abuse their admin powers, mute people, slap, damage, kick, and ban people because they think admin powers makes them above human rights. You're not a ♥♥♥♥ing cop, you're an admin of a server that means literally nothing, and I hope you NEVER join the police force despite me saying that you should join them if ranking means so much to you.  And if not for anything, people will always find SOME ♥♥♥♥ing reason to try and♥♥♥♥♥♥you off because they're too busy being the basement dwelling failures at life that they really are. Valve clearly doesn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about anything other than milking this game like a ♥♥♥♥ing cow to line dumbass Newell's pockets for his next McDonald's purchase (when honestly, this fatass should instead be getting himself a gym membership), because instead of fixing issues in the game that break it and allowing the game to be modded (like how Source, Condition Zero, and 1.6 could, and those were WAAAAAAAY better games than this horsevomit), they'd rather stick to releasing Operations and crappy knife models, and weapon skins (AKA DLC's) to milk every cent out of CS:GO, which is the very same cancer that's killing off TF2, and I'm surprised they cared enough to fix the ♥♥♥♥ing netcode and hit boxes in this game (which was another major issue plaguing the game for a very long time). Seriously, look at the ♥♥♥♥ing prices in the Steam community market for CS:GO, and you'll see skins that'll rise up to $400 maximum. Seriously? $400 for a ♥♥♥♥ing Karambit knife spray painted blue with StatTrak? I literally can do all of that with a Karambit in real life for less than $50, but these CS:GO nerds and fanboys want to draw the ""supply and demand"" card as if this were a real economy and like this♥♥♥♥♥♥actually mattered as opposed to playing the actual game itself. This is the absolute worst game Valve has ever produced, and it's all thanks to the community, because to be quite honest, when you're NOT surrounded by and dealing with the ♥♥♥♥ing abysmal community in this game (which is rare), this game can actually be VERY fun and engaging (like the CS I used to know back in the 90's and early 2000's) as well as enjoyable. I was actually VERY excited to hear about this game coming out back in 2012 until I realized how bad Valve ♥♥♥♥ed up with CS:GO and how the community increases the destruction by 150%. This game has legitimately caused me a lot of stress (and I mean legitimate stress) from the idiots I meet whether it's in Casual, Competitive, or Community servers, I can't get away from the Internet tough guys and keyboard warriors who I'd love to put on life support. Hell, I even have a video posted on YouTube on how awful this community is:  And that video is just the tip of the iceberg of how ♥♥♥♥ing atrocious this community is. DO NOT even consider buying this regurgitated ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's not worth $15, or even $0.01 of anyone's money. It's ♥♥♥♥ing cancer in software form. Again, invest your money in CS 1.6, Condition Zero, or Source, you know, the REAL Counter-Strike games and actual GOOD games that's worth money. And I bet you the neckbearded CS:GO fanboys who are still fat virgins with no girlfriends that dwell in their parents' basement all day are going to get butthurt and activate their defense mode and attack this review. Honestly, go ahead, I don't care, because you're only proving my point on how pathetic of a community you kids are considering one of you fanboys wish cancer on me over a VIDEO GAME. UPDATE: So Valve a little while ago released an update that fixed all of the hit registration issues that I spoke about earlier. They're definitely taking a step in the right direction and the game itself has been improving greatly, but one thing, which is unfortunately out of Valve's control is the community. It is still the very same toxic and cancerous community as I've stated earlier. Situations like this make me wish there was a yellow button instead of just a red and green one, because while the game is great, I can only recommend it to people who can get past this terrible community."

After all the years of playing COD i have finally figured out why I never had a girl friend. I was alone, played alone, lived alone, I thought it would never end... Then my friends told me about steam and after a while I found this game, Counter Strike: Global Offensive. I was excited to play it, i played it everyday NONSTOP until i felt like going to sleep. One day, I woke up and of course started playing cs go, I noticed what i have became...a csgo addict. I didn't know what to do when i was thinking of that. I quickly shut off my computer and went outside for once. I thought about what i was thinking...I decided to go back inside, still trying to get it out of my head...""a csgo addict"". I started crying...I didn't know what to do. I couldn't stop playing now...I have only just begun. I looked at all the money i had left and wasted it on cs go skins. The addiction is growing. I couldn't stop it even if a tried, thats when i realized...that i have fully became a cs go addict. To this day, I'm still a cs go addict. I love cs go and will never stop playing it... 10/10 Ruined my life that i never had..."

๖Koishi ♡ ✠,True,"The game where cash registers are accepted as SMGs. Step 1: Buy any SMG, preferably P90 or PP-Bizon Step 2: Get your teammates to buy the same Step 3: Stack together or rush together Step 4: Declare yourselves the cash register squad Step 5: Enjoy the sounds of multiple cash registers while firing your SMGs. OPTIONAL: Buy a name tag and rename the P90 or PP-Bizon into ""The Cash Register"" UPDATE: Hole punchers and staplers  are now accepted as pistol sounds! Check out the Glock-18 or USP-S and have your very own portable hole puncher or stapler in-game and form the hole puncher squad or the stapler squad!"

erni,True,"Global Offensive sprawia wrażenie przygotowanego pod dzisiejsze standardy, ale twórcy nie zapomnieli o klasyce. Po odpaleniu wita nas odświeżone menu, radykalnie zmienione w stosunku do prostych menusów, jakie widywaliśmy wcześniej. I tutaj zaczyna się kolejna zmiana, czyli podział gry. Dostajemy do wyboru – albo bawimy się według zasad ustalonych z góry przez Valve, albo wybieramy standardowe, prywatne serwery. Pierwsza opcja jest ciekawa z punktu widzenia początkujących osób, które nie są zbyt dobrze obeznane w zasadach, którymi rządzi się seria. Dostają bowiem możliwość wyboru, w jakich wariantach chcą się bawić, a następnie ruszają na znaleziony przez produkcję serwer. Trybów jest kilka, poczynając od bawiącego nas od dawna odbijania zakładników i podkładania bomb. Studio rozszerzyło jednak zakres konkurencji, dokładając Wyścig Zbrojeń i Demolkę. Ten pierwszy to nic innego jak synonim popularnego ""gungame"", gdzie po zabiciu określonej ilości graczy zdobywamy nową broń, a po śmierci niemal od razu wracamy do życia i ruszamy przed siebie. Rozgrywka jest szybka, giniemy co chwilę, ale zabawy przy tym jest naprawdę sporo, a przy tym to bardzo dobry sposób na trening strzelecki przed poważniejszymi wyzwaniami. Demolka to połączenie Wyścigu zbrojeń z klasycznym „plantowaniem”. Nową broń dostajemy co rundę, po zlikwidowaniu przeciwnika. Zabawa toczy się na specjalnie ku temu przygotowanych lokacjach, z tylko jednym miejscem na podłożenie ładunku, a do tego same mapki są mniejsze i jakby bardziej intymne, niż ma to miejsce w klasycznych trybach. Skoro już przy mapach jesteśmy, to należy im się kilka słów. Valve oddaje do naszej dyspozycji domyślnie kilka klasycznych plansz – Aztec, dust, dust 2, Office, Inferno, Italy, Nuke i Train. Są to lokacje-legendy, z garścią modyfikacji. Na jednych dodano dodatkowe przejścia, na innych poprzestawiano/dołożono/usunięto skrzynki czy inne osłony. W przypadku „Italki” aranżacja dodatkowego tunelu okazała się bardzo trafnym pomysłem, bo o ile wcześniej plansza ta bardzo mocno faworyzowała zespół terrorystów, to teraz szanse są niemal równe po obu stronach. To samo tyczy się pierwszego dusta, gdzie w podziemnym tunelu wyżłobiono boczny korytarz, po którym grzecznie schodkami można wejść na most, co wyrównuje z kolei szanse „tych złych”. Na reszcie mapek, jak już wspomniałem, zmiany są głównie kosmetyczne i w sumie ciężko ocenić to, czy wyszły one na dobre, czy na złe. Prócz klasyków mamy też kilka mniejszych lokacji do nowych trybów, robiących jak najbardziej pozytywne wrażenie. W ciągu najbliższych miesięcy pojawią się zaś fanowskie mapki, które bardzo często prezentują nieprzeciętny poziom. Na nie musimy jednak nieco poczekać. Sporo wyrazów już za nami, a tymczasem nie było jeszcze ani słowa na temat rozgrywki, a ta jest tutaj motywem przewodnim, nad którym twórcy wylali pewnie najwięcej potu. Po pierwsze i najważniejsze – to wciąż jest Counter-Strike. Możecie mówić, że gameplay nieco zalatuje Team Fortressem i być może trochę racji w tym jest, ale jądro rozgrywki pozostaje niezmienne. Brak możliwości strzelania przez szczerbinkę, brak przybliżenia (prócz sprzętu z lunetą rzecz jasna) czy kule latające według własnego widzimisię – to właśnie CS. Strzelanie w biegu jest totalnie pozbawione sensu, bo zamiast podziurawić przeciwnika, podziurawimy powietrze. Tutaj liczy się precyzja, trzeba przystanąć, oddać krótką i celną serię, najlepiej prosto w głowę, i iść dalej. Prucie ołowiem na oślep czy walenie po nogach daje tyle, co nic, choć czasami zabłąkana kula potrafi wylądować w czole przeciwnika. To również się nie zmieniło. Do rozgrywki powróciło ""skanowanie"". Kto grał w CS 1.6, ten wie, jak częstym obrazkiem były osoby strzelające po ścianach, by trafić stojącego za nimi wroga. Opcja była dostępna tylko w niektórych miejscach, bo inaczej zabawa nie miałaby najmniejszego sensu. W Source z tego zrezygnowano, ale w Global Offensive znów możemy marnować amunicję i walić w beton, a nuż kogoś trafimy, co dodatkowo zostanie wynagrodzone specjalnym symbolem. Tu jednak kończą się zabawy z fizyką, o ile tak można to nazwać, bo Valve wprowadziło jedno, dość irytujące ograniczenie. Pamiętacie przewracanie biurowych szafek czy przestawianie krzesełek na Office w celu zablokowania przejścia antyterrorystom? A może kojarzycie latające beczki, czy inne tego typu elementy? W GO tego zwyczajnie brakuje. Wszelakie krzesła, szafki, beczki, czy automaty z wodą są twardo przytwierdzone do podłoża i nawet wybuchający obok granat nie jest w stanie wyrządzić im krzywdy. Gdzieniegdzie zrzucimy ze ściany jakiś telewizor czy rozwalimy leżące na stoisku owoce, ale interakcję z otoczeniem ograniczono do minimum. Ciekawi mnie czy to celowy krok Valve, czy może wynika on z jakichś technicznych niezgodności. Strzela się natomiast bardzo przyjemnie. Grając miałem odczucie, że studio przy tworzeniu fizyki strzałów wzięło kod z Left 4 Dead, Team Fortress i Counter-Strike 1.6, całość wrzuciło do jednego worka i mocno wymieszało. W efekcie tego powstał dość unikatowy system prucia ołowiem, któremu jest całkiem blisko do ostatniej z wymienionych wcześniej gier, a jednocześnie cechuje go świeżość, przez co musimy uczyć się oddawania strzałów niemalże od podstaw. Początki, jak to w „CeEsie”, są trudne, ale na chwilę obecną wymiataczy zbyt wielu na serwerach nie ma, więc edukacja przebiega w miarę bezboleśnie. Co więcej, nieco mniej osób decyduje się na zabawę ze słynną AWP w dłoni. Być może wynika to z tego, że Valve nieco utrudniło strzelanie z tej potężnej snajperki. Rozchodzi się bowiem o to, że w w trakcie celowania przez lunetę, przy poruszeniu postacią, obraz na chwilę się zamazuje i dopiero stanięcie na baczność daje upragnioną stabilizację. Przeładowywanie karabinu poprzez szybką zmianę trzymanej w dłoni broni zostało jednak bez zmian i w sumie dobrze, bo brak tej opcji zniszczyłby jedną z cech charakterystycznych serii. Zmodyfikowano za to celownik. Klasyczne cztery prostopadłe względem siebie kreski zastąpiono czymś dużo bardziej skomplikowanym, składającym się z kilku ruchomych elementów, zmieniających położenie w zależności od ruchu czy pozycji, w której się znajdujemy. Nic nie stoi jednak na przeszkodzie by wrócić do bardziej archaicznego rozwiązania. Zabrakło zaś możliwości personalizacji menu służącego do nabywania ekwipunku, które przeszło gruntowny remont. Dość mało efektowne belki znane z poprzednich części wyewoluowały na podzielony na różne kategorie okrąg, który pewnie całkiem łatwo będzie się obsługiwać posiadaczom konsol. Na PC już tak wygodne to nie jest, choć po pewnym czasie idzie się przyzwyczaić, a do tego autorzy pozostawili możliwość szybkich zakupów przy użyciu klawiatury, więc de facto nowe rozwiązanie nie jest złe. Ciekawą nowością są zmiany w arsenale. Do składu broni dołączyły nowe rodzaje granatów, a wśród nich koktajl Mołotowa i Wabik. Ten pierwszy znajduje zastosowanie dość często i dodaje do rozgrywki garść taktyki. Możemy przy jego pomocy zablokować przejście przeciwnikowi, rzucając mu pod nogi płonącą niespodziankę. Naturalnie może on spróbować przejść po rozżarzonej ścieżce, ale ta odbierze mu sporą cześć punktów życia i spowolni jego ruchy. Kilka razy udało mi się tak uratować bombsite, gdy siedziałem na nim sam, a w tunelu zauważyłem wybiegających terrorystów. Szybko zagrodziłem im drogę ogniem, co dało mi kilka cennych sekund na poinformowanie kolegów z drużyny, żeby możliwie jak najszybciej pospieszyli mi z pomocą. Mało kto decyduje się bowiem na stąpanie po ogniu. Wabik, jak sama nazwa wskazuje, służy do zwabienia przeciwnika, symulując odgłosy wystrzałów. Wydaje się to być ciekawym rozwiązaniem, ale w praktyce mało kto daje się na takie oszustwo nabrać. Doszło do tego kilka nowych gnatów, innych zaś się pozbyto. Słynne M4A1 z wymiennym tłumikiem zostało zastąpione przez M4A4, a prócz tego poszerzono ilość karabinów snajperskich, dodano maszynowy pistolet czy nowe strzelby."
Tak hele ty debílku...,False,"The biggest problem of this game.  Community is full of Russians, screaming kids, Russians and again, you won't believe me - screaming kids. About 80% (maybe more) of my games I played with Russians was pure cancer. They didn't speak English, just &quot♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥"" and other sh*ts.  This also applies with kids - I don't know, how many times I heard 11/12 yo kids who f*cked my mother, funny :), isn't it? You can have a good score, like 36/15, you can win 9 rounds on harder side, you can sacrifice your soul to win, but still, with team score 14/9 on better side you can LOSE. Why, because they aren't able to do something good.  They want to kick you, if you don't clutch 1v5. They want to kick you, if you don't speak their language. They want to kick you, if you are 30 seconds AFK.  They want to kick you, if you are ahead of them. They want to kick you, if you are behind them. ( mostly if  they use only P90) They want to kick you, if you are 1v5 and you want to save an AWP or other expensive gun. AND STORY CONTINUES........ I really recommend to find a friends and play together. In game you can buy skins. Nice, you can ""upgrade"" your game how you want. But there fun ENDS.  Do you want some beauty skin on an USP? - Pay about 5€! Do you want some beauty skin on M4/AK47? - Pay 10+€! Do you want some beauty skin on an AWP? - Pay  20+€! NOT ENOUGH? Do you want some beauty skin on Knife? -♥♥♥♥♥♥your wallet and bank account and PAY 300+€!! No, I am not kidding. 300€ for pixels into game, that costs 10€. Ridiculous? Yes, I know.  Another thing you should know until you start play competetive. Believe me, rank in this game doesn't show your right skill. There are a lot of boosted accounts. You can get Rank-up if you are last with 2/10, but you can get Rank-down if you lose on first place with a good score. Even my friend got Rank-down AFTER WIN. Yes, it can happen, when you play competetive.   Of course, they improved it, but still VAC is quite broken. Because there are a lot of hackers. And how you going upper and upper, the worst it gets.  Maybe I should add this topic to COMMUNITY, but it's that important, so it deserves separated topic. I think, there are more and more and way more smurfs than before. It's a ""good feel"", if you get 3x oneshot headshot in row by 1 man. So, you want check out his profile, clearly for sure and then you see: Lvl 1 profile without avatar, only with 1 game - CS:GO with about 60/100 hours on it. I don't get, why do they create new Steam profile, buy CS:GO and play against weaker players. They gotta to kill lower ranks to get a higher ego? Why do they not play on FACEIT/ESEA?  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- OK, if you want to get the cancer, but you dont even smoke and these included cons don't matter for ya - BUY IT! :) MY OVERAL RATING - 5/10"

If an anti-cheat system could spot 40k hackers in one day, couldn't it spot them before as they cheat on every match they play? Do we need to have these VAC waves again and again? (11.07.2017)"

Dr. Rockso M.D.,False,"Valve turned this game into a sausage fest... with hats. Currently, the game has taken on a F2P/P2W grind-to-collect rare items, playtime incentive system, which gives the game a cheap social-media-tool feel. The 'hat system' is a clear indication that it is time to move on, some 15 years after the creation of the original, and break free of the stale CS formula. Bring something new and engaging to the table... please leave your hats at home. (This game was decent when first it came out and a year or so after - it was a blast teaming up with randoms and making friends to play competitive. The competitive mode really brought the best out of the what the game had to offer.)

CavalryBear,False,"Until Valve come up with a better matchmaking method (with almost 4 years since the release, I'd say there are no such plans) you'll be better off wasting your time and emotional balance elsewhere. Competitive is crowded with smurfs, poisonous jerks, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who find it amusing to ruin their team's match on purpose, cheaters and kids. To be fair, kids are probably the most pleasant group to play with cause they mostly try to play well, even if they can't. If you play really, really well - you may be able to ignore the first 2 groups. The rest will still be there.

Top it up with all the more frequent lags, server instability and general lack of communication from devs on server downtimes and updates, and you’ll have CS:GO.

Why would you make a BR game out of this iconic franchise is beyond me.You could have just made a second br game using source engine and put another dev team on it,insted you focused your resources on a mode that nobody asked for.    Danger zone plays and feels like an indie battle-royale,cs mechanics feel weird and out of place in a genre like that.Also most of the time youre using SMG's ,pistols and shotguns   my opinion,lowers skill ceiling drastically.On top of that - map becomes boring and repetitive after a few games because it looks like its made in 2007 with first stable source build valve released.Last operation was over a year ago and all this time youve been working on this?!?!?Why?WTF...Valve always values community feedback ,for example - overwatch,reddit,forums,workshop etc. , but this time nobody asked for this,if anything, people were sceptical.So why would   a right state of mind,start working on something so controversial and uncharacteristic to cs as a god damn BR...    Now about prime and CS:GO becoming f2p...♥♥♥♥ valve.Cheater problem was bad as it is,but now since you can buy prime cheaters are going to ruin even more games because nothing stands in their way,and I dont even want to imagine all the casual PUB's which are gonna be unplayable.Even if you get eventually detected,you can simply make another account and continue cheating,there is completely 0 penalty for doing so.     This company built all this hype around a terrible update.I was hoping for Matchmaking rework,introduction of seasons and rewards,something fun ,a goal for the casual players,maybe 128 tick servers or an operation because valve was working on something BIG... Now its all gone,they are going to focus on BR  mode,update and tweak it.Because of that cs as we know will stagnate even more and eventually  perish.Thanks for spliting your dev team even more,i look forward for the next update in 2022.Thanks volvo :) RIP CSGO 6/12/2018 goodnight,sweet prince..."

Revenant,True,"I bought this game for the chickens, and was not disappointed. After exploring the countless lands the chickens have traveled far and wide, I realized their population was growing too large. The chickens had started to inhabit such horrid locations across the world, such as nuclear plants, and offices without cafeterias. I knew what had to be done. I bought a flip knife off of the steam market, and called PETA. I listened to In the Arms of an Angel in my Microsoft Professional Deluxe Gaming Chair 360 for about twelve hours with no response, so, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I loaded up de_nuke and started to put the chickens out of their misery. I cried harder that night than I have ever before.  The next morning, with tears in my eyes, I loaded up Counter-Strike: Global Chicken, and I saw a new item waiting in my inventory. My Flip Knife had turned into a Flip Knife Slaughter. At that moment, I realized what a horrible thing I had done.  With my hand shaking, I navigated my mouse, and uninstalled Counter-Strike: Global Chicken.  I regret everything I have done. I am writing this review to warn you about the chickens, and to let you know I have made a full recovery, and that I have started my new journey in Goat Simulator. Thank you, and farewell."
Gomez,True,"Well hi and thanks for stopping by. After over 1000 hours of gameplay and reaching the LEM rank i consider myself expierenced player of CS:GO. If you are thinking about buying this game, you might find this review helpfull. What to start with... ? Surely if you are looking for highly competetive game, this is for you. You can compete with other players, and unlike in for example MOBA games, winning 1v5 is always an option. Beacouse this is the game where your personal skill matters. But thats not the most important thing. This game teaches you teamwork, of course if you are Scream's son you can just solo win every round, but its not the goal of the game. If you solo que in competetive, you will be put in a random game with 4 random people on your team, and 5 random people in the enemy team. They can be different nationaliy, have different characters and react to things differently. But for the time of the game, 4 of your teammates are you best friends. You are supposed to watch their back, coordinate tactics to execute best situations for winning a round and communicate as much as possible. Of course you can have a bad day, and meet 4 people that will not speak your language, will have a bad day as well and will try to grief you and loose the game on purpose. But thats just a rare percentage of my personal experience. You need to always stay positive and calm, and so will your team do. When it comes to game mechanics. CS:GO isnt very complicated, but its very original compared to other FPS games. You are aiming your crosshair at a guy, holding that left mouse button like there is no tomorrow, but you are still not hitting ? Try chilling out a bit and just tapping that mouse. Dont run when you shoot, stop, aim up, fire. Its the way to go in CS. You will get frustrated a lot, you will curse, throw your screen out of your window, but dont worry: When you master the game, there is no better feeling than headshoting an awper with a deagle, trust me. I mentioned a deagle... but there is a high variety of weapons in this game. Pistoles different for certain situations. Shotguns, SMGs, Rifles. You can even have your own Light Machine Gun ! But choose the negev, since m249 is worthless. Always felt MLG quickscope power in your veins ? Buy an AWP and the power of one shot kill (Unless you hit in the legs). Or if you are poor, just buy yourself a SSG08 and go for those tasty headshots. But to be completely honest, gun you will need to master at the first place will be AK47. If you managed to learn the spray pattern, the long range potential and the power of one shot headshot (To compare, no other rifle has that power... well except the negev and the deagle, but those are not guns you will mainly play) you should be good to go to play competetive. Competetive ? But are there any other game modes ? Yes of course. You have very old and popular arms race, where everyone shoot each other to level up the guns and in the end kill someone with a golden knife. You get the demolition. Something like competetive, but you are not allowed to buy guns, you level them up instead every round, if you get a kill. We have a deatchmatch where you can practice and warm up (And I reccomend starting the game with this), you also get the most famous :Casual. Full of unranked, new players, sometimes bored globals, but mostly people playing cs:go for fun, not for rank. Are there any other gamemodes ? This seems boring. Of course there are plenty of community servers allowing you to play Battle Royale, Deathruns, Bhop servers, Surfs, Hide n Seek, Zombie modes and A LOT other cool stuff that myself havent managed to discover yet. But wait, if the game seems that cool, there must be a catch to this. And yes there is. If you dont know russian... oh poor soul, wish you luck, since you will be yelled at a lot. You can also meet cheaters, obvious ones that just spinbot around killing you through 10 walls to boost the rank of some noob paying for it, or you can meet trying to boost themselfes with a slight aim assistance or bhop scripts, but its barely noticable. I rarely meet cheaters, and regulary fulfill my duty as part of the Overwatch. Overwatch ? What is this ? Its a system implemented in the game allowing you as a player to watch a demo of a game, where somebody got reported. And the person that got reported is the POV you will see. Its completely anonymus, but also helps catching people that somehow avoid the VAC system. But dont think you will get access to it easily, takes some time. Last thing i wanted to mention are... skins. And holy♥♥♥♥♥♥this like csgo has its own economy. For money you buy keys, for keys you trade skins, for skins you get skins. Since if you have skins, you must be a pro player, right ? Thats silly, but some of the skins used in game cost over 10k $ and its not a joke. You can loose money opening cases, you can get yourself this kinky knife skin you always wanted. But dont get addicted to it, since me myself spent way more money on the skins than I wanted.  Well... what can I say 10/10 Looking forward to playing more."
Zero,True,"In 1999, I crawled out of Counter-Strike’s wretched ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to become the man I am today. And, now, I’m tasked with rating the game. How does one even rate his mother? In sixth grade, I would wake up for school at 5:30 AM, but then I started getting up at 4:30 just to get a couple rounds in before class. Call it dedication or a sickening obsession, but I was hooked on CS (nevermind my neighbor who broke into my house to play while I slept!) It was more than a game. It was my social hub, my iTunes visualizer, and my brief entryway into game design (which didn’t go very far.) It is and remains a standout multiplayer shooter that paved the way for things to come with Call of Duty and Battlefield. Being eight years since the excellent Source remake, Valve has decided it’s time to give the game another facelift. What started as a Source port for consoles became a more ambitious project that included PC. While there are no radical departures in Global Offensive, it is without a doubt a reboot. Valve has just hit the reset button on the series, once again. As drastic and premature of a maneuver it may be, there is no denying that Counter-Strike remains an addictive and rewarding competitive shooter like no other."
confirmedScrub,True,"I don't really know why Global Offensive costs less than Source, but nevertheless, this is a great game, the successor of a real legend. It's a little hard to adapt if you come from games like Battlefield or CoD because of the recoil and no sights, but if you are dedicated, you can master it in no time. If you are a fan of shooters, you MUST play this game... but warning: it'll be addicting as hell."
Aleksa,False,What the hell???!!!! bought a game everything was fine just that new stupid update come out everything is lagging and crashing why you even update the game to make it worser???
menhera,False,"This game is slowly dying. Here's why Players: The community is getting worse and worse, as more and more Smurfers and Cheaters are coming in and Valve is doing nothing against that. Mechanics: For a game as big as CS:GO it's just sad. Many hits don't register, and that's because 64Tick-Servers and bad Hitboxes, but again, Valve does nothing. Anti-Cheat: VAC (Valve-Allows-Cheaters) is like nonexistent. Cheaters can Spinbot and OBVIOUSLY cheat, because VAC just doesn't work. If you want a working AntiCheat go play ESEA or Face.it, their AntiCheat does work. All in all, things need to change for this game to be fun for many people again, sadly, it still generates infinite money and probably won't die the next years... Changes would really be good."
platinum_miner,False,Recent changes to trading are disgraceful
Caca,False,"This game is full of hackers, and Valve just help them by making the game free-to-play. Meanwhile me as an Overwatch have to work for free reviewing match after match full of hackers."
vnon,False,Trade holds have have ruined the market for this game. Fix cheaters not something NO ONE has asked you to interfere with
barc0de,False,Too much haxker vac is useless
Bob Barker,False,"I can't recommend this game after playing +650 hours, the community isn't supportive or fun to play with anymore, the skins and ""mission books"" are just a way to keep making money off the same product that a very large community bought.  Source use to be fun when you hop into a server and you may or may not find the random a$$hole, but most people where very accepting and use to actually have great conversations and great games...but now its full of intense competitiveness that just makes people upset if you don't do exactly what they tell you when they tell you, even if you do what they tell you they will figure out a way that its still somehow your fault and not theirs at all. I do like competitive, but people (and trolls) need to lighten up. I know this part of the game and part of that ranking system...but that's why I'm there too. I don't just hop in for fun, I'm still looking for the ""W"". It's more rare these days to find a good set of people when you go into a casual map, but numurous people I know have had to mute everyone because again no one has anything productive or positive to say and it definitely takes away from the game.  Go play dirty bomb, or...well any other FPS other then this, cause its either going to: A) waste all your time and money or B) waste your breath on this deteriorating community. UPDATE 05/10/2016: The community continues to not be supportive and never want to have fun, just win, even on casual. Casual is a place where people are suppost to practise and improve on their game, but when players begin to argue and complain (again) on ways, they do not agree with others and they immediately kick you from the game. DO NOT BUY THIS!!! You are better off finding a brand new game with people who care about the community and to further their own fun while inviting others to do the same.  Oh, and if you have a stat-trak and want to switch to a new one without losing your kills it will cost you MORE MONEY ($1.30) TO SWITCH A SIMPLE NUMBER COUNTER. THEY ONLY WANT YOUR MOENY, ANYBODY AFFILIATED WITH THIS GAME/COMPANY ONLY WANT YOUR MONEY. I should mention the game is great (minus the hackers, trolls and things like the SSG jump shot kill [which I love] [They took this out in a later update]) if you're just looking to pass some time/hours and just want to blow peoples heads off, go for it. UPDATE 09/30/2016: I won't deny the AK ""sounds more real"" (barely), but all these new sounds make the guns sound like toys especially the M4A1-S. More children in the middle of the day play now when they should be in school or something and casual continues to be nothing but trash players and screamers that just want to make you deaf for some reason :/ . If you play this, competative might be your best bet for fun and good people. UPDATE 11/12/2016: Just came off a competative match and the group decided to kick me because I wanted to knife the other opponent, they were a bunch of kids all below the age of 14 and had nothing constructive or nice to say at all. I'm going to ask for my money back because this is one of the worst community's to play with along with poor updates and consistently making non-broken maps more broken/""balanced"". I have been playing on and off for years now and it looks like I may stay off this game for forever because of this toxic, unsupportive cretins and terrible company/dev updates that (again) don't help with stupid updates that don't improve the game, just their wallets. UPDATE 03/07/2017 (MM/DD/YYYY): Yet again just wanted to kill time, go on for a few casual matches and (as a terrorist) CT's have nothing but awps, autos and negevs for 4 matches in a row!!! Not rounds, games...different matches...same people, same sides, same guns. Literally not worth playing anymore...literally I don't know why I bother anymore. Again, don't buy. You're better off buying ANYTHING ELSE but this terrible time waster.  I know this review is long, but it's been a small reminder over the last 9 months of on and off play to just stay away, the only reason I keep coming back is just a time filler. Also, with the case drops I just sell them right away for the pennies (it's actually gotten me some good coin for some better cheaper games), it might not seem like much, but once you get that extra dollar it helps for DLC's or those pennies that push you over that ""money limit"" when buying games. I still personally don't recommend this game, but if you choose to buy it, have fun I guess :P UPDATE 09/07/17: Literally trash. Would though away if I could. All awpers in casual, no fun in competative...its a terrible game. Don't buy it. UPDATE 06/01/18: Full of A.D.H.D., nothing but office, dust 2 and some other over played ♥♥♥♥♥♥ map."
Reign,False,"Worst community ever. People are always yelling or playing music in the mic, throwing around insults, complaining about everything (you're doing too good, you're doing too bad, they don't like the weapon you're using, etc) and voting to kick people for no reason. I muted my mic, but then they get mad, because you cant hear them and yeah. Can't say I'm a fan of bullets not going toward your crosshair either, because of the recoil ""bullet patterns"". It's a problem since they're not random, so you're forced to learn them if you want to compete, because everyone else knows them.  So in those situations where you want to hold down the fire button for longer than 1 second during close range combat and go for a headshot, you have to aim at their feet, then a little to the left, then the right. It's incredibly frustrating.  Most of the time, you'll get beat by someone who took the time to download the recoil bullet pattern training map and mastered it. So if you have nothing, but free time to play this game everyday, feel like ""training"" and can deal with the overwhelming bad community, then this might be for you. Otherwise, I suggest not wasting your time."
Acute angle,False,"So, about that refund. When am I getting that? After all, the game has nothing but cheating ♥♥♥♥s, so why shouldn't we get a refund for making it FREE now?"
Freeballin,False,"I loved this game. I hate it now. It's riddled with smurfs, hackers and outright trolls. I'm sick of it. On top of all this my ranking system is ♥♥♥♥ed along with my matchmaking. I get placed with a team of trolls and idiots whilst the other team consists of 3 smurfs DMG on main. ♥♥♥♥ing cheers valve. This game is unique and the gameplay and mechanics are fantastic. However the game is dragged down by screaming children and trolls. I'm silver 3 with 97 wins and about 90% of my friends that are terrible at the game are a higher rank. I'm not amazing but I'm pretty decent. I top frag every game and I still don't rank up. Yesterday, I played one game. My team were a bunch of 12 year olds and trolls and I was up against 2 smurfs. Thanks. I get kicked, because the trolls think it's funny to kick people for no reason and then guess what? The rank I just worked 40+ wins to get is gone. ♥♥♥♥ing gone. I'm done with this game. My ranking system is glitched/♥♥♥♥ed and my matchmaking system is♥♥♥♥♥♥ Why am I so unlucky? Just why. ♥♥♥♥ing unbelievable."

Classy^^,True,"If you're not buying this game, I'm gonna spank your mother."
SpetsnazGRU,True,"Maybe the only FPS where it truly boils down to a game of pure skill. No ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t perks or kill streaks, no auto-turrets, no air strikes. If you want to win in Counter-Strike, you have to learn the maps, play smart, and have fast reflexes. Since you work for each and every kill, it's much more satisfying than other current gen shooters. It's a real shame that the console version isn't closer to the PC version though, they could have given COD a run for their $."

Dellie Shoes,True,"My brother is an ""avid amateur chess player"". That's how he describes himself when making small talk. You should see his room. It's full of dumb chess pieces from different sets, like his favorite Gold Pawn. It's not really gold but he claims it is. (Nobody believes him) So anyway, one time I went to his room and I saw a new addition to his collection. It was a giant paper mache bishop. Like, 3 feet tall. He obviously made it himself because it was crooked and I saw yesterday's news on the Bishop's belly. But what really attracted me to the giant bishop was its unproportionally small head. The whole thing was like a freaky baby milk bottle. So approached the artifact, and I bit the tip off.  Unfortunately for me, my brother saw me do it. Unfortunately for him, I move as quick as a fox. I was a dancing blur of after image, avoiding every attack he tried to throw at me. I slipped past him and dashed straight to the safety of my dad's room. I locked myself in until the angry beast outside calmed down. Then I asked myself,  . So I booted my dad's PC, which I also use for gaming, logged into Steam and saw that CS:GO was on sale. I bought it. It is an ok game."

Why not Zoidberg?,True,"At its core Global Offensive/Counter Strike is a brutal shooter which in its prime was probably the number one cause of broken Microsoft mouses. The emphasis on death is probably the only aspect of this series that has kept me around. It creates an atmosphere that games like Battlefield and Call of Duty hasn't been able to reproduce. On the outside Counter Strike looks like a simplistic shooter but the learning curve is steep and will challenge even the most seasoned FPS gamer. The game is simply tactful; it’s brilliant when you’re alive and even when you’re dead the game is still fun to watch other players. Global offensive is a competitive game and a casual one, although for casual gamers it's probably better to find community servers over Valve servers. There's a huge market place now for the items in CS:GO and not only that, there's third party websites and support for numerous other avenues these in-game items have created You will also find on Twitch CS:GO is consistently one of the most streamed games and boast numerous competitions, if you need any convincing watch a stream, watch a competitive match and see for yourself. This game is simply a must try and a game every gamer should have in their library. Overtime you can even make back the money spent on the game from the game itself."

Fast forward almost one year and my friend recommended I try it again. Well, i've got to say that the game has come a long way and has vastly improved from it's release version. The game is basically 1.6 with improved graphics and mechanics. While it still needs work in many areas, the current state of the game is highly enjoyable and worth the mediocre price of $14.99. If you're a long time CS player like me (Beta 1) and don't have this game yet, add me to your friends list and we'll reminisce about the old days and maybe i'll throw a copy your way."

It has many goals for you to achieve if you wish other than the obvious goal of getting the highest ranking possible. You could always aim to get that gorgeous weapon skin you always wanted potentially without spending any money at all. It is highly recommended you find a few people to play with as solo queue is extremely toxic, harsh and often rude, as in every other game that has competitive matchmaking. Having 4 people to play with can be extremely fun since you can easily bond together and have fun either you win or lose. It's a good game and I do recommend it as long as you're willing to ignore the (Admittedly plenty of) things that are wrong with this game. Even if you don't, it can easily be worth it if your skin is thick enough or you can utilize (If you got the balls really) self-deprecation humour."

StankTank,False,"Let me start off by saying this game is good, it used to be fantastic. THe developers of this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥game do not give two butt♥♥♥♥s about the players, they care only about money. Instead of making this game better and fixing bugs, they add cases and sprays. At times, I question why I I still play this god awful excuse of a game. The one great thing about this community was the ability to gamble your skins, and ecspecially csgolounge. Not only did valve attempt to fully cease operations on gambling sites, they also took down csgolounge, the biggest and most reliable betting site of them all (also a personal favorite of mine). On top of these horrific displays of costumer servive by valve, they also have a ranking system that is so ♥♥♥♥ing slow that i could litterally rank up faster in the actual U.S. military. And dont even get me started about the god damn morons you find in matchmaking. I often find that 99 out of 100 of my teammates that i am randomly get queud with are absoulutely brain dead, and have little to no knowledge about the game and how it functions. Now on to a very important issue that is troubling our community, the grill (girl) population is extremely scarce, you could imagine my frustration as a man trying to get in some dank phone sex after a compettitive match. Not only this, but it seems as though the grills that are playing csgo, 1. pay no attention to my extremely rushed and desperate advances toward them. 2. grills also seem to be treated like gods in this game, (even though they are all really ♥♥♥♥ing bad) and almost always have extremely expensive inventories. And on to my final issue with this game, the man who runs the show.... yup, thats right, im talking about you Gaby boy. Gaben, also known as gay piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥fan boy obese nerd online legend real life loser-having♥♥♥♥♥Gaben has slowly destroyed this game, due to the constant uploads of new cases and operations, just so that fat bastard can get some more cash from twelve year olds around the world.

szpenio,True,"there is no game out there that I got as much into as I got with cs:go. All started with me watching competative matches on warowl's channel. and I saw these elite players with their godlike skills and fancy new skins (the arms deal update came around). and I was like damn, I want to play like them. so I bought the game. I wasn't sucking bad because I'm a visual learner and learned most of the basics by watching the pros play. but I wanted more. I learned the spray patterns, shot a wall to learn the recoil over and over again and soon it came to the point where I surpassed all other players in casual matches with ease. the spray patterns where in my muscle memory, my reflexes with the awp improved, my nades landed where I wanted them to land and the addiction swallowed me whole. I'm going to break 1000 hours this week, I have a 300 euro inventory, a clan that get's better and better by day, a youtube channel and the best thing: endless fun. You can play gun games, awp servers, minigames, jails, hide and seeks, deathruns, aim servers, knife servers, surfs, deathmatches, demolition games and many more not considering casual and matchmaking games. And if you think you will get bored of the maps you're wrong. The maps don't create the gameplay experience, it's the players + every half a year there comes out a new operation with additional new community created maps and community created weapon skins. it costs 5 euros, but if your friend has the operation you can join his game anytime without being blocked by the game or forced to charge. CS:GO is a game that will 100 % occupy you if you're eager and competative or even if you just love community based games with a sht ton of human interactions through VoIP"

Ticklish_Turtle,False,"I cannot recommend CS:GO. Valve lacks adequate transparency in rectifying the ongoing issues present within CS:GO (i.e. cheats, game play performance, etc.). Additionally, the crawl to level 21 (i.e. a requirement to play prime account matchmaking, which slightly decreases cheating encounters) is grueling given that the number of cheaters in non-prime results in slowed leveling; competitive matchmaking consistently provides the highest XP reward, which is dependent on rounds won.  Valve relies on a peer review system (i.e. Overwatch) to punish potential cheaters, which serves as a   solution that is supplemented with VAC (i.e. an ineffective anti-cheating solution). Cheaters are not deterred as an overwatch conviction commonly results in the individual obtaining an alternate account. Despite Valve’s profit margins being nourished by superfluous additions (stickers, temporary graffiti, skins, music kits, etc.) the game has been lacking substantial content in the form of  , which are accompanied by new maps. The previous operation occurred almost a year ago, which far exceeds the average time between the last six operations of five weeks. Also, the gaming community is vitriolic - there are countless incidents of bigotry, griefing, etc. – it's a Sisyphean struggle of always wanting to expect the best out of CS:GO before being unfailingly reminded of its shortcomings.  After nearly 1000 hours, I was left exhausted and resigned myself to the rampant cheating - I piecemealed together my own cheat using articles from numerous public forums. Expectedly, this resulted in me being overwatch banned after countering a series of cheaters in competitive prime-matched games. This 'other side' does not provide any reprieve - even the slightest tinge of a perceived good play, whether assisted with cheats or not, provokes the veiled hackers.  I give up on this game as Valve has long before me. tl;dr                                                          …………………./´¯/)                                                         ………………..,/¯../                                                         ………………./…./                                                         ………./´¯/’…’/´¯¯`·¸                                                         ………./’/…/…./……./¨¯\                                                         ……..(‘(…´…´…. ¯~/’…’)                                                         ………\……………..’…../                                                         ……….”…\………. _.·´                                                         …………\…………..(                                                         …………..\………….\… CS:GO  - Kyle Davis (Valve) - In-Game Economies in Team Fortress 2 and Dota 2 Steam Dev Days 2014"

First I want to say thank you Valve for making a nice game like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive! BUT: There are some things Valve has to change really fast! 1. Cheating: There are more and more cheaters every fu***** day! The VAC-System isn't as save as it should be! I hope Valve is working on it! 2. DDOS-ing: I think the Valve-Servers should be very save, but then there is the DDOS-ing! How is it able to get the IPs from your opponents this fast and DDOS them! Please fix the Serversecure! 3. Smurfing: Through all those Steamsales you get more and more smurfs! Highranks buying a new account to play against lowranks and get really horny about it! I think they should make an IP-Based system where the rank is linked to the IP or something like this! 4. Patches: Patch after patch, the game is getting worse! They nerf every weapon till the weapon isn't playable anymore! With the maps you have the same problem! 5. Serverproblems (also Steamserver): Steam and Valve aren't able to fix their serverproblems, so the game isn't playable because of laggs and disconnects! Also the cooldown you can get is very unfair! This is fu***** s***! 6. Community: The community isn't as good as I hoped. Most of the people are pretty unfriendly. Over all: Counter-Strike isn't playable anymore! And the higher the rank the more hackers you get! Please fix the things I listed above and make the game playable again! And I know that Valve can't fix the community, but I hope the community will get better! PS: I'm from Germany, so there are maybe some spelling mistakes!"

Tails™,True,"Once again, Valve never fails to deliver an epic title such as Counter Strike. For years, the Counter Strike community was divided into two titles: Counter Strike: 1.6 and Counter Strike: Source. But now thanks to Valve's latest Counter Strike adition, we can finally bring back the family all together. The addition of skins are all bonuses that make Counter Strike: Global Offensive even more enjoyable, following Team Fortress 2's hat and drop system. The money being used for E-sports for the best to take place in. The competitive rank system that finally matches players equally based in terms of skill and tactic, as well as giving you the prestige for winning. The game is not perfect, but then again no game is. But what seperates most games from this one is the fact that the beloved developers of Hidden Path Entertainment are always listening to the fans while working together with the top players to try to achieve the perfect gameplay (although there are many features that could be similar to DOTA 2 to make it even better, but Valve will learn soon). Thanks to this game more and more people are joining the community of this game and we should all work so that this game, or should I say franchise becomes the best First Person Shooter series EVER!"

TheQuinster™,False,I want to keep liking counter strike but I can't because it's just been going deeper and deeper down a terrible hole.

Twisted_omeN,False,"Well you're down here looking at reviews so either you're looking for a laugh, looking for someone who agrees with you, or are legitimately deaf to the social world and need this second opinion. If you're gonna read this just know this isn't written completely out of spite, it's just my way of rationalizing how such a decent game can cultivate one of the most horrifyingly sadistic and brutally toxic communities I have ever seen in my 18+ years of gaming. Well, here we go... If you value your time, self-esteem or general sanity, I advise you stay as far away from competitive as possible. Stop. Don't bother. Save yourself the heart condition and stick to casual. Or don't play at all, that would be the optimal choice. This game is a test of character, not just a test of skill, and I will tell you why. This game splits everyone into one of 3 categories of player, the one who is bad at playing but can learn and improve, the expert player who harrasses and belittles all others for not being good enough, and the trash players who votekicks and teamkills reguardless of target or skill. This, of course, is nothing new and is pretty common in all online multiplayer games. The harshness of this game, however startlingly eclipses all other communities I have ever seen, creating a sinkhole of reason and leaving everyone with pure hatred not only for the opposite team, but every single person on their own team. You see, like the snake that consumes it's tail, all players that stick with this game end up reaching the second archetype, who in turn become the harrassers after all the hostility they put up with. They go and become the average player in the game, maybe a youtuber, who baits others into trying the game and constantly filling the quota of targets to harrass and belittle. It's a self sustained cycle that has slowly ramped up since the game first came out in 2012, which I can attest as I have been here since the beginning (my hour count doesn't reflect this, so it doesn't relate). That's not to say this is a bad game, no no no. It's just that the entirety of the community is toxic and spiteful, with about 3/4 of them (a generous measurement I'm sure) that WILL sour the game for you. On the other hand if you somehow fit into this description, then by all means try your luck. I promise you your newly found anger management disorder will find a perfect home in your life. If you've made it this far you're either intrigued by what I've said thus far, or you are skipping to the end to see my point. Well either way here it is: If you really want to play this, whether it's for a friend or personal interest, stick to the casual and more open game modes, otherwise I guarantee that you will not like the outcome. Even if you do decide you like it, you will reach a point where you reassess what you've experienced, the community you've exp[osed yourself to, and eventually decide whether you want to put up with this anymore. It'll be your loss, but also your lesson."

✪ Rose-iwnl-薔薇,True,"This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here.Global Offensive is definitely a Counter-Strike sequel -- it looks and feels familiar, with minor tweaks here and there to help balance old issues and surprise longtime players. This is a demanding, skill-based multiplayer game that's as satisfying now as it ever was, but it's for a specific kind of player. If you're not willing to learn to play different than you're used to, look elsewhere. Otherwise, this is a top-tier tactics game that will probably share the long-tailed legacy of its predecessors..."

But gamers like myself chuck all the complaints and rants into the bin and enjoy the essence of Counter Strike. But all this changed with the introduction of skins into the game.  I personally have no issue with this concept, I myself own alot of them, but I personally feel the developers should spend more time on patching up the glitches and developing their VAC system, because this game is infested with hackers.  So I dont reccomend this game for the sole reason : hackers everywhere.  Ratings - 3/10"

Now you might say I'm just ""bad"" but I've been playing this game for almost 2 months(Yes that's more than 1400 hours!), and the game's physics are like my third hand by now. This is just outrageous that the official valve competitive servers can be this bad. You're better off playing on 3rd party leagues such as ESEA, that have decent servers, and more often than not, cooperative teammates. Moreover, the competitive servers are full of edgy, underaged players who talk down to the opposing team aswell as their own, regardless of your skill. There is an option to mute other players but that just ruins the entire point of the game if you can't communicate with your own team in order to fabricate a strategy to win the round. Nevertheless, that's bound to happen in any game, but its been on the rise on CSGO servers since its debut in August 2012."

petskuletsku,False,Community is toxic af.
-Aro-,False,"is a brilliant game, there is no doubt about it, defintely my favorite multiplayer game that is available today! However, a game should be played purely for the sake of fun,     the perfect combination of competetive and fun, but whether or not you actually manage to get any enjoyment out of it constantly feels very doubtful in the games current state. Simply put,   is a modernised version of the   everybody knows and loves, only this time it has a ranking system and   so that you always get a  , sounds awesome, right? Too bad that at the moment, matchmaking seems to be  . I will elaborate, but first I just want to throw out there that the gameplay is fantastic, I am not here to dispute that fact, but rather that a game that relies heavily on it's community to truly thrive is ultimately damaged by it in the long run, even if there are still a handful of people that do great things for this game, see the people that dish-out endless tutorials and tips such as WarOwl & 3kliksphillip for example. 9 times out of 10 you are likely going to have at least one player in the game who is either smurfing or cheating, (let's not even get into the odds of you getting a ton of griefers in the game altogether), some quick online searches will show up some results about how the anti-cheat measures are making very little difference, especially when some of the most proffessional and famous   players have even been found out to be cheating somewhere down the line. Checking the player profiles after a game will also turn up a shocking amount of players that have had VAC bans in the past, and while that doesn't necessarily mean they are still cheating, it is not out of the bounds of possibility.  Another annoying issue in this game like many other multiplayer games is that if you want to play with people that aren't touchy teenagers or pre-pubescent children that do nothing but give out grief, racial and homophobic slurs, then your best bet is to play it with a group of friends and hope that no cheaters or smurfs managed to find their way into the enemy team. But hey, if you play this game with the right people, it is still a great experience, whether you win or lose, I have met some great people in my time playing! Unfortunately these great people are   outnumbered by the bad ones, at least that was my experience. I still believe that the good outweighs the bad, just ignore the idiots if you can, even though it will be impossible to do so if they resort to team-killing and intentional friendly fire (which you will see   of), I guarantee you'll be using the ""Block Communication"" feature  .  I know as well as the next person that it can be frustrating to have somebody on your team who isn't very good or just new to the game altogether, but these people paid for the game just like everybody else and thus deserve to play like everybody else, instead of kicking and griefing them, try helping them instead. Everybody was new to   at some point in time and the veteran players aren't going to stick around forever, remember that.  So until Valve are able to do something about all the cheaters and smurfers that currently plague this game, I can't really recommend it, regardless of how much I like the game itself. It's situations like this that make me wish Steam's review system had a ""Mixed"" option cause it really does pain me to click ""No"". For a game that is fun and competetive,   is one to buy, but whether or not it is a fair game will depend entirely on what straw you draw in the matchmaking. If you're having a lucky day, you may actually get a good and fair competetive game on the go, but let's just say the odds aren't exactly in your favor.  If one day the matchmaking has vastly improved, then I will happily rewrite my review and give it the positive one it deserves, but until then I'm afraid I can't. Another issue is that in the update cycle for this game, things often end up even more broken than repaired. As of right now there are some serious problems with frame rate drops and hit detection, which you probably imagine would take the highest priority on the developer to-do-list, but no. Skins, cases and all other forms of micro-transactions always take the highest priority. I appreciate that Valve is a business and that their goal is to make money, but nobody is going to stick around to play a broken game when they eventually get fed up of it like I and so many others have. We paid for this game and it is your duty to maintain it and make sure everything works like it's supposed to!  On one final personal note, I really wish that there was some kind of option to disable skins in-game and maintain only the default models. They're bloody ugly and ruin the immersion, but this is only a personal gripe.  Amazing game, but ruined by it's community and poor maintenance.  As of January 2017, I decided to try playing this game again to see if things have gotten any better. I'm afraid not, it's still in poor condition, hit detection is even worse and the community is still as toxic as ever. But hey, at least the cash-cow is still flowing in the forms of ""Glove Cases"" now, right? Sigh..."

Full of kids & hackers. Overrated game because of the name it has. 4/10
TheBadassNub,False,"This community is rapidly going to hell...Its quite apparent that the so called Professional players of this game over 65% are hacking which can be viewed on youtube which the Developers allow them to do such as its consistently brining in revenue. Average Player base these people tend to buy seperate accounts to play with lower ranking players to make a name for themseleves of how great they are. Streamers tend to get carried to ranks that they can't play at and then state how they are having a bad day because the people who carried them to that rank can't play with them that day. The lower end players the brand new players tend to buy game hoping to have fun and get trolled all the time.  One of the current issues they have adjusted for the game is kicking players+leaving game are rolled into a negative effect. This should be 2 separate issues, If i kick someone for being an♥♥♥♥♥or going afk too many times and per that week I am already on a 2 hour ban from leaving a game I then recieve a 24 hour ban.  So say you have a player that goes afk mid game how do you get rid of him wait til he disconnects to be able to use a bot to even the playing field. However this game allows you to mess with settings in console so now you have players going afk the whole game by running in circles in spawn thus never leaving due to creating an action in game. So the only resolution is to kick them...However if you have kicked multiple people or in that week's time had a cooldown you will get a much longer cooldown for doing something postive. Gun drops in game have been reduced it use to be you would recieve between 4-6 drops a week now your lucky to get 2 drops usually cases which require a $2.49 key to open.  So as this has gotten less and less the Community has begun promoting underage gambling websites to gamble your skins in hopes to getting better skins to make profit off of game. Which is disturbing when you connect to the game and you hear a 9 year old talk about his up's and down's with gambling his skins away.... I would not recommend buying this game unless you intend on being a troll and can stand not getting agrravated by other trolls on this game."

Just trying to rank up is literally impossible seeing the people that actually play this game either greif, hack, or flame.

It's about 1/5 chances you will be put in a good PUG and not only that, the game is infested with hackers.

my life is a bruh_2.wav,False,"After over 1000 hours of CS:GO and countless frustration I have quit this game and moved onto other things. The support for this game is pathetic. Valve is a company with no community management and all they care about it money. The CS:GO servers have been down for over 24 hours with NO communication from the developers. Valve refuses to fix the problems that plague the game such as:  -God awful anti-cheat (You get cheaters in almost every game at higher ranks.) -Terrible hit detection. -64 tick servers. -Terrible FPS with each update. -The report feature that does close to nothing. Valve doesn't care about anything but how many skins and gloves they can pump out for money. I recommend everyone to go spend you money on a more supported game like Overwatch.

Pepper,True,"Well I have 200+ hours on this game, and I don't know why but hey, here's a review. Pros: +Has the option of competitive +Fairly Balanced +No Game Changing items +Fair Economy (Skins and Items) +Easy to setup (Lobbies with Friends, Custom Crosshairs/Changing Viewmodels) +No way to gain an advantage (Except Skill) +Good Anti-Cheat and Overwatch +Teamwork is needed Cons: -Very Toxic, occasionally helpful, community. (Full of Trolls, Ragers, ect.) -Some weapons can be used so abusely and unskillful as it makes the game unfair. (P90) Edit: This can be combatted by approaching the P90 users from a position that gives you an advantage. Credit goes to Bunnikinz! Thanks for the advice! Neutrals: (Depending on how you see it, it can be viewed as a pro or a con) =If you disconnect from a competitive match, you have 3 minutes to get back in or you cannot get back in even if you do get back on. (One of my friends computer bluescreens occasionally during comp and his reboot time isn't enough to get back on time) =Ranking System, the ranking system prevents smurfs from appearing as often but gives the new player a huge grind before being able to play competitive. (Smurf = A skilled player, usually of the ranks Distinguished Master Guardian - Global Elite, who makes a new account to play with lower skilled players often ruining the game for the opposing team.) Also as you move higher in the ranks you will find more hackers, especially in Supreme First Class and Global Elite games. What most players do is go on ESEA servers where their Anti-cheat is a bit better than Valves. Final Verdict: 9/10 although the game is really good it does has somethings I'd like improved. What I'd like to be improved that can be fixed: +Report System, As much as the VAC system is good, it's always going to be flawed as it won't be able to detect a hacker 100%. Valve is trying to fix this with Overwatch, a system of which hand-picked players (usually high ranked and have many hours in the game) review a demo that is recorded of the game of whom is reported from and votes on whether the suspect is either hacking/greifing or not. What most youtubers who record Overwatch and people who use Overwatch want, they want to see what the suspect is reported for as when reporting someone you're given three options: Hacking, Greifing, or Other.

Kino,False,"An intense, story-driven game written by the community, brought down by glaring flaws. The plot revolves around a bunch of screaming manchildren locked into a constant battle for guns with paintjobs. Hack wars commence, scams are carried out, and viruses are created in an attempt to gain any leverage possible. As one of the many players of this war, you must choose your allegiances properly. Will you simply be another ""casual"" and be called every name in the book by others for poor performance, race, sex, etc? Will you become one of the elitists and make money off of the guns? Or will you maliciously assault your fellow comardes and enemies alike with verbal harassment? Unfortunately, your character is outnumbered and outgunned. He must be a hyperactive drug addict, as he can run around at speeds that would make a Ferrari blush with near-instant acceleration but cannot shoot straight to save his life. He can shoot the first two shots accurately with some degree of randomness, but past that he starts flaiiing his arms around and begins shooting the sky in a vain effort to kill God rather than the other humans shooting back at him. Fortunately, your enemies are usually as incompetent as you are, so most battles turn into a spamfest of bullets as both sides scream racial slurs at each other and hope their bullet hits the other guy. Of course, a lot of times, much higher-skilled players posing as low-tier enemies will go up against you to fulfill their own malicious power fantasies. These people are called ""smurfs"". They function as boss fights and usually hurl taunts and insults your direction. Beat them to see them break down villainously and accuse you of hacking. Of course, there are also hackers. Some are possible to beat, others are not. They have added advantages, such as x-ray vision, computerized aiming, and a jetpack that allows them to hop across maps at blinding speeds. Have fun with that. The soundtrack is poor, as there are very few tracks in the game and most of them last for only several seconds, and you will hear them all within two minutes of playing. Valve does allow the purchase of soundtrack DLC, which only give you different very short tracks for the price of $7. This is a very shameful business practice, and one has to wonder why EA gets fluff for this but not Valve. The graphics are rather ugly with blurry textures that look like they were ported from the original XBOX and lifeless environments. This is said to make the game competitively playable, but everyone knows good video games like Call of Duty all have giant neon signs and lens flares that obscure vision. The optimization is rather poor as well. On my state-of-the-art 2011 laptop loaded with an Intel HD 3000, the finest in graphics card technology, it gets a pitiful 25 FPS in menus with performance usually worse in-game. This leads to frustrating deaths as I see my enemies teleport around and shoot me in the face, or I suddenly freeze in place and again get shot in the face, in which they will usually taunt me with expletives. This is absolutely unforgivable for a game released this decade. My computer can run Crysis. The loot system in this game, however, has much potential. The guns you can get nearly rival Borderlands The Pre-Sequel in originality, design, and neon colors. However, unlike Borderlands The Pre-Sequel, the guns cost real money on either the outside-game service Steam Community Market or by opening cases, which cost $2.49 per attempt and usually only yield Common-grade loot. This is disgraceful and exploitative of the consumer base. Gearbox clearly has it right, as unlike Valve, they never release overpriced DLC for their Borderlands series. As Valve have shown they cannot design games, they should hand off Half-Life 3 to Gearbox Software instead. Overall, this game is outdated, treats customers like crap, has little content, unintiuitive gameplay, a terrible community, bad level design, and more. Stay away and buy Call of Duty Modern Warfare 17 instead. 69/420"

Faxx,False,"The game itself : good. The community : the worst. Your teammates are actually your ennemies. And while the griefers, trolls and smurfs are annoying they can somehow be dealt with. The biggest problem is that the higher up the ranks you go, the bigger the egos get. Insecure manchildren then turn into full on bullies making solo queue unbearable to play. The only solution is to somehow make friends and play with the decent people, which requires planning, 4 people of your own rank with the same availability, and doesn't then allow you to play ""casually"" in competitive mode."
R'lyeh,False,"UPDATE 18/02/2017: New insight on the game. You can read my old review below. Since my last review, which was posted in July last year, not much really changed. Just some 'small touches' by the devs, you know - they added sprays to the game, so now instead of having a small chance to drop a half-decent weapon skin you could sell on market for some profit you now have an even smaller one, with sprays dominating the drop table. And, yeah, they're cheap as hell. So if you wanted to profit out of this game, I wish you luck. Other than that, they introduced skinnable gloves. So yeah, with knives being the past 'most expensive' skins in the game, now you have gloves, which are even rarer. As you can probably tell, Valve's moneygrab tactics are blooming. They recently announced that they're working on a remake to de_dust2. Great to see they're focusing on the most important things that should be fixed, instead of wasting their time with a map revamp </sarcasm>. What about the matchmaking? Glad you asked. Prime system doesn't do much, as people can register with throwaway phone numbers and still be queued for Prime. Which means that it doesn't help jack. If you queue without Prime, however, your chance of encountering a cheater rises up to approx. 95%. Not sure who still uses Overwatch, but that doesn't seem to help. Reporting people wields results after long periods of time, or not at all. I wouldn't be surprised if at this rate Valve partnered up with cheat providers for more profit, since hacking in this game is easier than stealing a kid's candy... and seems it still goes about unpunished. And, almost forgot, they introduced public lobbies. For the first few weeks it was what you'd expect, random people jumping on your lobby and starting to screech autistically. Now? Hey, now you have like 7-9 bots instajoining your lobbies that you can't kick. So, yeah. Still broken, and Valve still doesn't listen. Cause, you know. MONEY <3 If you like shooters or Counter-Strike in general, do yourself a favor and play the good old 1.6 or Source. Global Offensive promised to deliver an upgraded experience of those good shooters, but, as it is universally known, they stopped at promises only. While the improved mechanics of the game and the indulging competitive mode are welcome additions, if you came for those reasons, well... you will be disappointed. This game had a rough start, and I'm fairly sure you know the story. It wasn't too well introduced, hit near-rock bottom and then scored a 'miraculous' revival thanks to the skins update. That's when the devs really cared for the game, and tried to provide as much as they could so that the players liked it. Sadly however, they stopped as soon as the downfall of the game was no longer imminent, as at this point it seems almost absurd to consider the game as successful as CS:GO dying out in the foreseeable future. And that's exactly why it's no longer as good - the game is plagued by hackers and smurfs, essentially destroying the pure pleasure of defeating an enemy in close quarters, scoring a faraway headshot with a pistol or winning a clutch. Surely, those feelings are quite alright - but they are buried really fast upon encountering somebody who's not abiding by the rules. VAC is no use, devs haven't devised a way to avoid matchmaking you against a smurf, the greatly promoted Overwatch system stopped bringing relief after a while and Prime Matchmaking doesn't look promising either.  Competitive games we all enjoy playing are now a lottery - you either get a complete one-sided slaughterfest thanks to unfair play, or finally get a room to breathe and play a single well-fought game, with a chance of somebody joking around and killing the pleasure yet again. The icing on the cake is, as I already mentioned, the skin system. Instead of focusing more on the security so that the game is actually playable, we're getting balance patches so that the pros can feel a little different during tournaments, new cases to milk the money out of twelve year olds' parents and more useless stuff. In short... not recommended. tl;dr: the game is STILL full of hackers, smurfs, trolls and raging kids who 'f*ck your mother'. It kills every little bit of enjoyment and at this stage, I wouldn't recommend buying it... maybe when valve drops another sale and starts caring for our enjoyment and not our money for once."

This is a great game that is super fun, but with the cheaters that have been flooding the servers it is impossible to have a good time... I if want to cheat and own people trying to just have a good time on there free time then this is the game for you... otherwise find something else to invest your time into, maybe a single player game..."

BLAIRHEXOR,True,"Really fantastic and balanced game! And think about the competetive aspects you could compete: - Queing up vs fullpremade teams as solo! -Getting kicked out of a ladder game just for fun for having a disconnect, even if you have 10:0 stats.  -If you arent familiar with russian greetings you should inform yourself before joining a game, else you would be  confused about♥♥♥♥♥♥BLIAT VODKA VODKA, YOUR MOTHER IS A *BIEEEEP*! - Do you like arabians?? Better be friendly to them, because teamkilling is what they stand for. - Matchmaking is starting 4vs5 games, enjoy your bot!  - People get random Matchmaking bans, because they can`t reconnect due to bugs! -You have to decide what player you are, you have 2 options. You can be the noob or the hacker.  As Noob you basically have worse than 1,0 kd. As Hacker you are above 1,0kd, pretty simple, isnt it.  -Oh and if you meet people who are Global Elite after 20 hours playtime, dont be afraid. Its okay. The boy/girl is just playing on one of his 37 smurf accounts.  I can really recommend this game if you live in russia and your IQ is below 70! Or you love the sound of ongoing 13 yo german gangster-rapper screaming in your ears, this game could be for you.  If you arent sure yet if you should buy this, just check out some hacks in youtube which are available for cs:go. Its awesome. You see flying people who shoot with homing bullets through 10 walls while screaming in voicechat, YOU ARE ALL NOOBS, BUHAHAHAHAHAH. And honestly, who would want to miss something like that :) ? If the current bugs are taken serious by valve the game might leave beta stage in like 3-4 years. Buy it right now!"
Memes,True,"A beloved and fun ""Team based Multiplayer"" Game , we all love how russians or turkish people learned us new words , we play with em as a ""Team"" , we learned to play as friends , you KNOW you can trust every one!

Isaac Clarke,True,"Global Offensive is the latest franchise in Counter Strike. Awesome new layout in the main menu and the same goes for the buy screen when the start of a match. After each match, the weapons that you are currently using will be load up on ammo automatically. There are several new weapons in this franchise, so...you can look forward on using all the weapons. Another thing that is new in this game will be the weapon camos, I am not 100% sure on how to get this....but from what I've heard from my friends...you can keep on playing the game until you unlock new camos in-game or you can make your own unique camos in the Counter Strike Global Offensive Workshop. There are 5 modes in this game: Demolition, Arms Race, Competitive, Casual and Deathmatch. New maps are added in the game or...you can choose to download extra new maps from the Counter Strike Global Offensive Workshop for more fun!! I recommend on buying this game when it goes on sale!"
Tabajara,True,"Counter-Strike still keeps the award of the best action multi-player game in the world - 1#! Global Offensive proves that and will make you addict in this game. More gamemodes, more weapons, re-designed characters/weapons; and maps totally rebuild in the last Source Engine to bring the best FPS experience ever for you. Highly recommend this CS in your Steam account. 10/10"

Ank,True,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a first-person shooter and the next generation of Counter-Strike running on updated Source Engine and has many new features added. The gameplay is also has been revamped so even new players can play the game without much difficulty. No need to buy weapons ammo anymore. There are many new game modes such as deathmatch, arms race and the competitive online match. There's also the new Arms Deal update where each weapons now has many skins which can be acquired when you play on VAC enabled servers in a timed based item drops or by opening a weapons case with certain bought keys. Weapons skins can be used to show off, traded or sold on Steam marketplace. You can even change your weapons name and add some description about it. You can also submit your own weapon skins or maps if you have the creativity so that maybe Valve will add it in the next game update, therefore supporting the game even further. Graphics in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has been vastly improved. Characters model are all fresh new while retaining the same design and faction with some new faction added. The map is upgraded even better to look more realistic than ever. The new Source Engine also made the ragdoll physic effect and many effects feels more realistic. Despite all of the upgraded graphics, the game runs amazingly smooth and optimized and doesn't really need high-end system. Oh, but before you buy this or even play the game, you better be ready to throw yourself into a real hot zone out there, as the community of this game is... well... unforgiving. You either die as a noob or live long enough to get a title hacker. This is yet the best Counter-Strike game where casual and hardcore gamers can play. I recommend this. Rating 9/10"

Jynxix,True,i suck at this game and rarely play it 10/10
Lacas,False,"I used to like this game alot... i played 600 hours in like a year which is alot for me. and as of the day i wrote this review, this  became my least favorite game... its filled with hackers in competive matchmaking. i cant even play one competitve match without getting a hacker. bad choice on the devs for making it f2p."
Phobos,False,"Before I begin, allow me to say that I reached GNM from GN2 in one week and I was playing with MG1 players until my last game. After a couple of years playing, I have no other choice but to hang my AK and M4 on the wall, and unistall this game that entertained me like few ever did,   at the same time. Why is that, you may ask? Allow me to keep you busy for some of your precious time to elaborate. Until a few years ago, this game was one of the best tactical FPS you would find out there. It was fun, rewarding, and filled the gap between casual gamers and gamers that where seeking a bigger challenge. Of course, there where the usual trolls, hackers, smurfs, flamers, but they where merely the minority. Most teammates where good people to play with and made you enjoy your time spent bombing or defending sites. And this year, 2016, not only many celebrities died, but also the fun this game once offered. Now, it's impossible to play competitive without a team of friends you know that can play well. And for a player like me, that enjoys a little bit of solitude now and then and testing his own powers alone by going solo, that means one thing:  Playing with others is not a bad thing, don't get me wrong. I already explained why I enjoy some alone time every now and then though. But playing with others means I don't get to play when I want, or reschedule other games and free times for the sake of competitive. It turns into something like a job, full of schedules, stress, pressure and complete lack of amusement. To top it off, the game's players can be expressed in these categories: Smurfs ruined this game more than anyone. Being assigned against/with players that are, in reality, way high above your skill means you don't get to improve, you won't make any progress in rising through the ranks, and if you play against them, it's almost certain you have already lost. Then you have cheaters that can take on entire hordes of you and your teammates alone. More fun lost. Overwatch is not doing much to punish cheaters and despite VAC, people still cheat with, you guessed it right,  In other words, it's pointless to try playing competitive with the player base being such a fake one this period. Hence, I quit until one day I hear this game is getting back on the right track with fewer smurfs and cheaters. And I strongly recommend not to buy it, or at least stay as far away from competitive as possible."

󠀡󠀡Jaf,True,"Lets ignore the aggressive silvers and *cough* Russians *cough* and focus on some positive aspects: Gameplay 9/10 The gameplay itself is on par with perfection, with customization options such as crosshair (shape, size, color ect), left or right handed play and of course the beautiful console interface which makes everything just THAT more simple. Very good :) Pixel-walkers will be shot. Graphics 8/10 The graphics are very good, utilizing the source engine to it's full potential. Awesome maps, awesome scenery. Even skins that you can literally sell your soul for to make your play-style feel a little more... Classy. It better be worth it though because you're probably now homeless, because that FN Dragon Lore you just bought cost you a re-mortgage of your luxury condo. Sound and voice acting 10/10 Beautiful sound, even back in Counter-Strike: Source, Valve has used awesome audio design, with a good quality pair of headphones, you can hear every step around you, so take advantage of it! The ability to sound ♥♥♥♥♥ is amazing when you're 1v5 clutching and you hear 3 guys to your right and 2 to your left, but can determine their distance based on sound alone, amazing. They have done it right. The original CS:S voices such as the ""Terrorists Win"" and ""Counter-Terrorists Win"" are still used in CS:GO today! Recently CSGO was updated with a new Audio Codec, making those Angry russians screaming &quot♥♥♥♥♥♥BLYET"" just that little bit extra crisper and tasty. Good job Valve! Game physics 8/10 Coming from the HL2 Engine, the physics in CSGO are on par! To the weapon recoil, to the boost spots, to the nade stacking skills to the casual birds flying in the sky. A few issues with pixel walking especially in the professional scene (DAMN YOU FNATIC) but I think most have been sorted and patched out :) Community 6/10 Okay, so here is where i have my biggest issues. Yeah it's not the best community, but it usually depends on your rank, In Silver/Nova you're more likely to encounter toxic players who leave/troll and harrass so much that you want to literally uppercut your monitor but as you get better (and more tolerant of said individuals) and see your rank increase, you'll realize that Valve has a large hacker/cheater/smurf issue. Gaben is taking care of them in waves, but you know, how big can the waves get before you cause a Tsunami... you get me? No? Okay.. well... I'm sure they're doing something about it... sure. Overall experience: 8/10 (Amended: I found the community somewhat lacks, yet there are some awesome YouTubers that you should check out if you're interested in exploring the GOOD side of the CS:GO community. Trilluxe and Sparkles to name a couple.) It has some problems, but I'm still enjoying this game. Everyone should at least try CSGO! Updated regularly, bug fixes and such, regular tournaments, LAN events ect! New maps every other month, new skins every other WHENEVER, brilliant. Highly recommend you play this game, despite the abundance of cheaters and pro-level players getting involved with cheating, you should play this game. DON'T CHEAT THOUGH!

Everytime I get killed I cut a little slit in my arm to hopefully teach me not to die. It has not been working and I have gone into a deep depression. I do not recemmend purchasing this game that infects you with a spite to kill yourself and other, and that creates a void that only gets filled from winning matches and getting promoted.

If you play casual and you are at least above average player you could make nice score and be one of top players of the map with a lot of MVP's. Casual can be sometimes painful coz from time to time you will run into few toxic players but stil can be fun. If you play ranked (competetive) matches and lets say again you are at least above average player you could be top player almost in every match (ofcorse lets hope u don't run into cheater or some skilled player on smurf account) and you would gain ranks relativly easy ofcorse higher rank = higher skill group so more chance to meet your skill level people or better then you (remeber there always someone better, nobody is godlike). If you want to gain fast XP for account rank best way is to play ranked matches. This game is INFESTED with cheaters, not playable anymore, time to make LONG LONG pause. New additional info: Game is updated FPS diference is like 100fps now it warries from 120fps - 290fps it's idiotic and just to mention new sounds ingame are also idiotic Stil no improvements only more and more disapointment, sadly.

Lelouch,True,"So, after 1000 Hours of this game, I know pretty much all I need to know for a review. This game is amazing and all, but there are a couple flaws. I am currently MG1, and it was a long road to get there. I had the troubles, of when I got on a large win streak, I would be on a game I was certain I would rank up, then of course a hacker would have to be on the other team. All we could do was report them, and then get on with our lives. Then, after another long win streak, I was about to rank up when I got Derankers. Of course, all I could do was report them for griefing and move on with my life. Then, there is the factor of constantly versing smurfs. There is a small chance of winning when against a smurf, and it gets on my nerves when there is a whole team of smurfs against just a normal team of my rank.  If you can get games with no smurfs, derankers or hackers, this game is amazing and I enjoy everything about it other than what was just mentioned.  I give it a 8/10."

Joshnl >:|,True,"CSGO is a near-perfect multiplayer shooter. Unlike the previous versions, which were often difficult to get in to, this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels. It has a large community and a well supported workshop, ensuring that this discount-priced game will be around for years to come. In short, you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round, which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster. It's been around for years and has spawned many imitators. The game isn't much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original Half Life 2 was. However, Valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis. Is it worth getting if you already own Counter Strike: Source? Yes. CSS was always Counter Strike shoe-horned into the Source engine. CSGO feels far more like a standalone game. Valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game. The best feature must be the competitive play. You cannot leave these matches or you'll suffer a temporary ban from the feature. After 10 wins in this mode you'll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill, meaning that the game is challenging but fair regardless of your skill level. These matches are exciting, occasionally scary or frustrating, but are the most rewarding part of the game and improving your rank is one of the most satisfying experiences in any video game, ever."

tibi smrbaietii,True,"The latest installment in  's   series brings us great, addicting gameplay, a colourful, alive world in a game that combines great mechanics, with great performance. It is my   most played game, soon to become the first. The item drop system is similar to the one in  . At the end of a match you may or may not receive an item. A skin, a weapon case, you never know !     The best way to play, is to play competitively. The game has a Matchmaking system, that finds you a nearby server to play on, with 9 other players to fill your 5v5 match. This is where you have to play good, where you have to win.    After your first few matches, you will be given a Skill Group. That, is your rank. It's based on your  K / D ratio, and the amount of wins and consecutive wins you've had in previous matches. The Matchmaking system's job is to match you with players of your level. If you don't wanna play serious, though, you can still hop in the thousands of servers with random stuff! Deathrun, Zombie Survival, Deathmatch, you name it! It's still tons of fun. But the real deal is in Competitive.     So, what are you waiting for? GET IT !"

My opinion, however, is that this game's competitive ranking system is total garbage.  Now before you go on raging in the replies saying ""ERMAGURD GO BACK TO COD MAD CUZ BAD GET GUD LUL"" please read the following. This system is poorly designed because you constantly have to be paired with good teams in order to win games and thus rank up in your competitive rank. For the uneducated, the more games you win, the more likeley you are to rank up, but if you lose games, you lose your rank. When you are constantly being paired with people who don't have microphones or toxic squeakers who don't know what they're doing, you derank all the way to silver one. The non comeptitive rank literally means nothing and is just there to look nice, which in my opinion should determine which skill group you're in for competitve, but nope. The system Valve built requires you to get lucky and be paired with a decent team that can communicate easily and knows what they're doing, which won't happen unless the planets align during a full moon.

GoldenPhoenix,True,"This game is one of the best balanced tactical games that I have seen.

The simplicity with which one can begin playing allows almost everyone to play and enjoy the game. The details of the game, the same since the year 2000, bring such minute differences between the skilled and the amateur that the skill ceiling is nearly unreachable. The only  poor quality of this game is the toxicity of the players. This game is great for beginners and elites of FPS gaming alike, but those who are sensitive may want to get a slightly thicker skin before playing, as any and all mistakes in this game are looked down on harshly by the majority."

I'VE GOT LUMBAGO!,True,"It's a great, fun game, but: Competitive matchmaking in the Silver ranks would be a lot more enjoyable if they weren't filled with the following players (keep in mind you will find some people in the higher ranks acting like this. Just look up a few Youtube videos that recorded some arguments on CSGO): 1) Mr. L33t, the egotistical, temperamental♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥who blames everything on you or other teammates -People like Mr. L33t think they're good. They're ones who feel entitled to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s because they think their skill will win the game anyway. Imagine the following scenario, okay? Here it goes:  you're playing a match defending a bombsite on the Terrorist side. Mr. L33t is carefully watching the bombsite's right flank as a sniper. An enemy player suddenly appears, who also has a sniper rifle. Mr. L33t and the enemy player try to one shot each other. Since you don't want to peak the sniper and get killed insantly, you hang back at the bomb site and play it smart like your other teammates. Mr. L33t, on the other hand, wants to get that kill so bad that he ends up getting sloppy. Then Mr. L33t dies. Soon enough, you end up being the last living member of your team, and you're still hiding. Meanwhile, the enemy team also has only one member after all the fighting. Now, you know this guy has a sniper rifle, so you ain't going to peak. Of course, there's a problem. He can approach you from multiple sides. You have two choices to approach this situation: A: You can take a risk and look for him, and if you're lucky enough, kill him. However, the downside to this decision is that if you end up dying, Mr. L33t will say ""YOU ♥♥♥♥IN' IDIOT! YOU SHOULD'VE CAMPED! B: You can continue hiding in the same spot and hope to ambush them. However, if the enemy player has a good guess that you're hiding in that spot, he will prefire the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you and kill you. If you die, Mr. L33t will say something along the lines of ""YOU ♥♥♥♥IN' IDIOT! YOU SHOULD'VE PEAKED AND LOOKED FOR HIM!"" Or he will be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at you for not prefiring, even though if you did, you would never have hit the enemy player and instead give away your exact position, so even though the enemy player had a guess of where you're hiding, now he knows for sure.  So which choice is the right choice? None, because you never had a chance to kill him in the first place and would die regardless. Meanwhile, Mr. L33t will be busy telling the whole team to join his circle jerk of hate, because clearly you are a bad player for not being able to kill him. You could, of course, tell Mr. L33t that if he were such a good player, he would have killed him long before it even became a problem, but it's clearly not his fault because he's the most important snowflake on this team. And remember the last round he tried to clutch as the last player? Yeah, he didn't clutch that match either, and he did far worse than you at it, but he decided to ♥♥♥♥♥ at his teammates anyway for not giving him proper call outs, even though that's exactly what you did. What did this guy do? He didn't give you ANY call outs.  You know what's worse than playing on a team with Mr. L33t? Playing a game with 2 or more Mr. L33ts. Let the vote kick commence, but it's not like having them kick you off the team will make any difference because they're going to lose the competitve game anyway. 2) Mic Spamming Mikey, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who spams ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sound loops, songs, memes, and other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ BS in a comp match who wonders why the team can't hear any callouts. You would think Mic Spamming Mikey is a troll, but unlike other mic spammers, Mikey is taking this game half-seriously, so he's putting in some effort to win, although it's not much, mind you... Basically Mikey thinks everyone enjoys the BS he ♥♥♥♥♥ out of his mic, because listening to his stupid songs that have lyrics like ""touch muh wang wang"" and ""I'm so fresh you can suck muh nuts"" are clearly more important than listening to callouts. Nobody's going to be able to hear call outs with loud volume like that.  Then comes the moment where a teammate dies, then Mikey says ""OMFG HOW COULD YOU NOT HEAR THE CALLOUTS? VOTEKICK!""  It's even worse if Mikey turns out to have the same personality traits that Mr. L33t has. 3) Jackass Jimmy, the idiot with no sense of awareness. Jackass Jimmy isn't a noob. He's been playing this for a while. However, he still plays like♥♥♥♥♥♥ so he has absolutely no excuse to be an idiot. Jackass Jimmy still doesn't know call outs, recoil patterns, the difference between camping and rushing, and a whole lot of other obvious♥♥♥♥♥♥that you need to know. Jackass Jimmy is the type of person to hear someone say ""They're rushing B! They 're rushing B!"" and still stay at bombsite A because he doesn't know how to read a map. He's the type of person to fire a gun full auto at point blank range and still not kill his intended target. He's the type of person to buy an auto sniper, only to miss every shot with it and give the enemy team a generous donation of an OP weapon after getting killed. Jackass Jimmy isn't even trying at this point. 4) Trolling Tommy and Backup Billy Trolling Tommy likes to troll competitive games just to♥♥♥♥♥♥people off. He'll do anything to get on your nerves, whether it's purposely playing like♥♥♥♥♥♥ getting in your face to keep you from using your gun, flashing your teammates, ""accidentally"" teamkilling you, spinning around in spawn, and a whole list of other♥♥♥♥♥♥ Naturally, such behavior warrants a quick and hasty votekick, but not for Trolling Tommy. You see, Trolling Tommy always comes with another equally stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥called Backup Billy. Backup Billy also likes to troll the game, but he prefers to blend in with the crowd and act like he's not part of it. Backup Billy's job is to keep Tommy from getting votekicked, so he'll always vote no. He'll lie and tell you he voted yes, then blame it on someone else. 5) Hacking Harley, the hacking piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥from the enemy team who keeps you from winning. In most circumstances, hacker accusations are unfounded and usually are wrong. However, in cases where there clearly is a hacker in your competitive mach, Hacking Harley just loves to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off with their aimbot, wall hacks, spinbot, whatever. Forget having their team votekick them. Those guys want a quick and easy win. Enjoy losing a competitive match that could have easily been won by you if everyone played fair and square. 6) Mr. Salty Mr. Salty has a temper like Mr. L33t, but Mr. Salty doesn't brag about how good he is. Instead, he gets♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off over trivial things. He will team kill his teammates for accidentally shooting him, making the whole team lose the match. He'll get angry at you for trying to give him advice. Mr. Salty is the type of person who has been on a losing streak in the past couple of matches so anything will♥♥♥♥♥♥him off.  P.S. Casual matches would also be more enjoyable if we didn't have the following idiots: 1) Mic Spamming Mikey (he's a full blown troll here) 2) Tryhard Johnson - this guy is just like Mr. L33t, except he's even ♥♥♥♥♥ier and treats casual like a competitive game. He won't give new players the chance to learn and will vote kick them on the spot if they make a mistake they can afford to make. You know, because it's casual, and people try to get practice out of it..."
✪ Hollandje,True,A definit big yes for me. Super cool game and a lot of fun when playing with friends! 9/10!
starguard,True,i just wish this game had a story line its always like why are we here? why are we fighting these terrorist? why are they blowing up these tcrates?
SamboNZ,True,"CG:GO is a blast to the past; a nod to the old-school days of the late 90's, and it's more than welcome in my gaming livery.  Whilst I love COD and Titanfall, there's something uniquely compelling about starting up a match of CS:GO, with it's deliberate and stayed pacing, and it's risk vs reward gameplay mechanics, it's no wonder this game has taken off for the 3rd time in it's lifecycle. It's popular right now for a reason, and that reason is good. A must-buy."
GG.Sunshiners,True,"Another game by the valve company, its the Counter Strike ! The game that we all should love. The competitive part of the gameplay is full with teamwork, skill and tactics, its nice that team with a leader (A guy that command his/her teamates via team chat or voice chat) will always win if they are against a team without a proper leader. Soo the teamwork in this game is very superb. All the weapons in this game is balanced, so no matter which gun you used, as long as you can used it, you can kill even an opponent with a more expensive gun than you, i see alot players with a 800$ weapon win against a players with a 5000$ weapon. And if you didn't like competitive you can have fun too with a Call of duty style team deathmatch, and free for all. Its really fun, all you need to do in this mode is to just kill the enemy, killing another players in this mode is really fun and a stress reliever. Recommended to all competitive and also casual players ! PS: You can actually earned money from this game item drop, so you can actually have fun and earned money. :D"

TechSexy,False,Thank you valve for ruining one of my favorite game
Bushmaster Angelo (Cupcake),False,"""2 days ago, December 7, 2018, a date which will   gamer infamy. the veteran CSGO community, was violently and deliberately attacked, by instincts and greed, of the Empire of Valve.  The Valve community was at peace with this once great nation, and at the solicitation of Valve, the promise of the introduction of Half-Life 3 and the promise for a great, prosperous community. Indeed, 9 days after the release of Artifact, the game's reception has received Mixed reviews and a score of 77% by Metacritic. The game had lost half of it's playerbase within a week and the numbers were plunging consecutively. While this playerbase criticism was still on the rise within the ""Artifact"" community, Valve did not give out a direct response. It will be recorded that the Battle Royale trend and Valve's indirect cohesion within it's community makes it obvious that the trend continues to fuel our Lord and Savior ""Gaben"" with greed and instinct. This trend may have been planned for weeks or even months. During the intervening time, Valve Software has deceived us with the hopes of giving the things we desire most from our Lord and Savior, with the abandonment of the Half Life campaign and it's writers. The trend 2 days ago has been widely received as negative and ""F2P"" and a deliberate ""waste of money"" to CSGO community. A that day, they have given us the pointless ""Prime Status"" to ""Honor"" those who have played for thousands of hours. Clearly, it was an indirect apology made by developers themselves. Valve, has undertaken a deceitful advantage over it's playerbase extending throughout Steam. The facts from 2 days ago and the days to come speak for themselves. The People of Steam have formed have already formed their opinions and well understand the implications to the trends and cringe that will affect our great community. As a common speaker of the CSGO community, I have suggested to prepare your♥♥♥♥♥♥for the upcoming 9 year old invasion and prepare all global elites to take any direct measures to fight back against the coming horde. But always will the Valve community remember the deceitful lies our lord has brought us."" DISCLAIMER: I made this as a joke review because I thought it be creative as hell. This is also to commemorate for the fallen of the Pearl Harbor attack planned by the Empire of Japan, I give credit to FDR for creating the original and thought provoking speech for Congress and the people of the United States. However, I still give this a negative review because I don't agree with valve's instincts of making a BR gamemode to attract a community of children to play this game and the Free to Play option. But thank you for stopping by."
Kjall,False,"*Meanwhile in Valve HQ...* ""Let's make this a skill based game"" ""but add tactics that takes no skill whatsoever to make it extremely hard and painful for ones who are trying to get better"""
30Cents,False,"The CS:GO community has grown since it was first released a few years ago, but that doesn't mean it has gotten better. The community has inevitably grown to something much more than it was originally intended to be. What do I mean by this? Well I'll point that out. 1. The number of hackers/cheaters has only gotten bigger over the years and Valve isn't doing anything about it, unfortunately. Yes, the VAC system works, but there are some cheats out there that are undetectable, an example such as LMAO Box (which is also heavily in TF2). Valve doesn't care about their own community in terms of cheaters/hackers, but they can fix this, by improving the security of their ""reliable"" anti-cheat system.  2. The community is full of trolls and jerks. There will always be at least one or two trolls within a server trhat you currently play in. There always be someone screaming over the mic, cursing out other people, and overall being more or less of a big annoyance. There's nothing you can do about either, you can't mute the person within the game, you have to deal with it or you have to mute your sound or leave to go to another server, which defeats the whole purpose in getting a higher rank. You can also decide to have a poll to have the user kicked off, but this never works. They will always attempt to vote you off if you are caught voting the targeted user off. It's also really annoying when someone voted to reset the server match over 50 times because they died and everyone votes to reset the match. No one cares for other people's enjoyment, they only care about themselves.  3. The economy in this game is demanding. There will always be people asking for things, such as knives, weapon sking and stickers. The first time I heard trading was introduced in this game, I knew it was going to stir trouble. Like TF2, people trade for greed and wealth, not for playing the game for fun. Speaking of which, your always made fun of if you don't have a skin attached to a weapon, not everyone wants those things you know!  CS:GO is turning into TF2, Overwatch and COD all at the same time. The community has only gotten worse over the years and Valve isn't doing anything to improve/fix this. I don't want to think of this as another TF2, but unfortunately, that is what it has become and it will likely always be that from now on, because Valve wants all their games to be similar in terms of their other multiplayer games."

micho_z,False,"No! Jist, no. Now, you may ask, after 1600hrs of CS:GO, why I don't recommend this game? It's obvious that is not about the gameplay. CS:GO as any of the CS games has, one of the most addictive and challenging gameplay ever. Technically the game is perfect: good graphics, fast respond updates to bugs and problems. One of the best anti-cheat systems in the world. Yep, better than Blizzard's. (You may not agree with the sentence about the anti-cheats, but I will explain this down.) And, even the market for ""goods"" and DLCs is perfect. It's focused on the older and more experienced players. Lots of ""skins"" for the new players and new ""operations""(maps) for the older players. The more you play, the better this game becomes. Like I said, technically perfect on any aspect. The problem comes form the game community. You may agree with, that the most of the players in this game are 12 years old kids with urgent desire to sleep with your mother. And, after few hours with the game you will become a polyglot linguist, mostly in slavic phiology (Polish, Russian). But this aren't the main problem. The problem is in the COMPLETE tolerance, the COMPLETE ignorance and the COMPLETE lack of knowledge from the community, about the CHEATERS. This game possess one of the most complete anti-cheat systems. It covers every aspect of the game: VAC- automatic anti-cheat program, Overwatch system for precise observation. This two programs are in constant communication with the main game and the ""Matchmaking system""- so, all of the cheaters to end playing against each other and to get banned. But, ...BUT... This system relys on, the ""willingness"" of this community to use this system, to deal with the cheaters. Unfortunately, by this complete negligence the system is doing more damage to the people who are willing to help by using it. Rather than to the cheaters. If you are ""new"" to the game. My advice is to skip this game and don't start it."

Kutar FOX,True,"PROS: - Skins (you love them.) - Stickers (some are pretty.) - Competitive matches (they can make you ""1337"".) - Life time support and updates confirmed (operations, tournamënts, and other future contents.) - Reasonable price (minus low discount rates for those want another copy.) - Cheapest Steam trading cards on Steam Market. - Still a ""classic"" FPS game in terms of gameplay. - Source Engine is not power hungry and thus the game is widely accessible for lots of players regardless of their computer setups; this is one of the important factors to be a popular game. CONS: - Skins (you can't have all because: rarity, monies, life issues, et cetera.) - Stickers (some are ugly.) - Competitive matches (they can ""rekt"" your mind.) - It is somewhat hard to find and make a correct teabag position to desecrate fallen foes and allies due to ragdoll physics being client sided (you often see teabaggers teabagging side by dead bodies, not exactly on the bodies.) Teabaggagement must be well practiced with rich malintent and delicacy in order to execute and demonstrate a successful teabaggary to variety of audiences. - You can't kill hostages anymore unlike in previous   games. - You miss the Arctic Avengers and terrorists in the green jackets. - Multi-GPU setups (SLI or CF) can potentially cause stuttering issues and even some FPS drop. - AWP needed nerf? (3/31/2015 update.) - StatTrak swap tool (3/31/2015 update.) - Our money magically disappears from time to time. - Time goes too fast. - Addiction. Final Remarks: Valve. . RECOMMENDED ."

Juiceloops,True,"Well, this game is amazing, and is very different from the past Counter Strikes. Graphics have improved alot, which I believe why many people love games because of their graphics. (Graphics aren't everything). As of the past Counter strikes, you would have to find a server with the particular gamemode that you want. (Arms race, Deathmatch etc etc) In CS-GO You wont have to worry about that, they have different gamemodes where you could actually choose to play in besides finding a server that has it. I have also notice that this is fairly alittle bit easier than any of the other counter strikes, probably since they reduce the recoil a bit? But either way, tap firing is always the key. Also many Unique Features they have added in this game. First off, there are the skins. Many people disliked this idea since they probably thought CS-GO would be ""like"" Call Of Duty. Well, adding skins doesn't really mean anything, it just makes you be able to battle in style. Not to also mention offline mode. Offline mode is basically playing with bots. Now, some Counter-Strikes did have bots such as Counter Strike Source, but I just thought it was nice that they would add ""bots mode"" back.  Counter Strike Global Offensive is way different from any other FPS (First Person Shooter). It's much harder and takes a bunch of skills seeing the fact that many players are already pros. So, that's why I play Offline mode. If I were to rate this game out of 10, I'll probably give it a 7.5/10."

You're gonna start at the bottom of the rank lists playing against people with over 40'000 hours who literally just bought a new account to ♥♥♥♥ you up and tell you how homophobical they are, or how they banged your mum and dad and sister and brother last night. Ideally, you're gonna become better, actually you won't, but you will be sometimes carried so hard through your games that you'll manage to get to some decent ranks, where you'll get stomped because you play against people who sacrificed their girlfriends for pure reaction time and insanely inhuman skills. Talking and having fun at this stage is basically impossible, since you will have to drop down everything that might even slightly decrease your attention, e.g: Your baby, your girlfriend, the phone, the doorbell, everything. After 500 hours you'll get to the elo hell, Legendary Eagle Master, where you are gonna face off exact copies of KennyS, ApeX, olofmeister and more. The insults at this stage of the game become so heavy, that you won't be able to sleep for weeks. After a few months of playing, asking yourself WHY you play this game, you're gonna get out of LEM and become SMFC and then GE. Now you're the one whos stomping. HA! JOKE!

BlaZZeReD,False,"2018 Review: WHY IS CSGO FREE TO PLAY?! HAS VALVE GONE MAD??!!??!! 2016 Review: - Great maps - Team focused - Fun custom servers - Skill based - Become a pro and make a living playing for a team and playing tournaments/majors (Esports) - Smurfs (Master Guardians playing in Silver, Distinguished Master Guardians playing in Gold Nova, Legendary Eagles playing in Master Guardians, Global Elites playing in Legendary Eagle, etc.) - Scammers - Toxic Children - Mic spammers - Russians will bottom frag and yell at their team to play better - Very Addicting - Everyone is egotistic - Hackers - You'll top frag and carry your team but wont rank up because the ranking system is based on how often you win, not how well you perform - VERY difficult to rank up, VERY easy to derank. - Poor balancing - Doesn't have 128 tick servers - Poor hit registration - Toxic community - People will rage quit after losing 2-3 rounds - No one wants to work as a team, everyone wants to be a pro - Everyone thinks getting frags is more important than winning rounds - Players often mistake friendly criticism for toxic trash talking and will become toxic themselves The Cons ruin the game. Smurfs and hackers make MM (matchmaking) unbalanced, and make it harder for you to improve and rank up. Many Silvers who should be Gold Nova, many Gold Novas who should be Master Guardians. People will accuse someone as being a hacker or a smurf because they play well and carry their team, but often times the good players cant rank up because better players are smurfing and keeping them held down in the lower ranks. For me, personally, smurfing is the biggest issue I encounter. Either the other team is being carried by a team of smurfs (2-3) or I will have smurfs on my team throw the game because they are trying to derank. Also, since the ranking system is based on how often you win, and not how well you personally perform, you have to pay the price for losing and derank with the smurfs. Also if you are playing with people lower ranked than you, (ex: you're GN3, friend is Silver 4) you will derank within 1-2 losses if you lose. It is also almost required for you to have friends to play with, because in MM there are many players who queue on a regular basis, meaning they are better coordinated.  (Coordinated team vs 5 stranger team) And everyone who seems to be searching for a team are Silver 3 - GN1 or GN4 - LE.  Sucks trying to find a team around the ranks of GN2-G4 when the only people offering to become a team with you are the players who are worse skilled. You can win 8 games, and no rank up. You can lose 4 games, and you will derank. Other people seem to have more issues with playing with toxic russians, toxic children, hackers, and hit registration. There are WAY too many issues with this game that Valve refuses to address. The updates they make are cool, but don't fix the game. They add a lot, but don't fix the game."
alvy,False,"I have played this game since October of 2013 and nothing has been fixed, they continue to add broken weapons and being unable to properly balance weapons, the Tec9 is still OP, it took them months to fix the CZ, the M4A1-S is still the king of CT weapons due to its lowered spread, recoil, and higher damage at ranges. The hitboxes are still awful because of how animations are blended and not snapped into place, you need to be rank 3 to play Competitive even if you're a Global Elite or Legendary Eagle Master, meaning you have to play with Silvers for 6 hours if you want to play Competitive, it's especially bad considering you have to buy an Operation Bloodhound pass to get XP faster. They should've just kept it the same as it was in January of 2013 without the flash boosting, the C4 planting and jumping hitboxes were still messed up but it was generally just a better game. I refuse to play this game until they fix the hitboxes, which has no ""ETA"" currently but ""Valve has acknowledged it"" so basically they said ""screw you, we're not fixing the hitboxes, thanks for the money."" What a joke of a game developed by a joke of a company, I can't believe that they have let the game get to this state, and Valve's support is a joke in general, enjoy waiting 2 weeks to get a reply. EDIT: I know all the dumb and blinded fanboys are going to dislike this review, but believe me, you will feel this way when you actually look at the technical aspects of this game, and believe it or not, there IS a game beyond betting and skins! I know, hard to believe."

Jared,True,"- 2 teams (ct and t). aim is to run around and try get as many kills as you can. - different point values are awarded depending on the weapon used when you get a kill. - which ever player gets the most points will win the match for there whole team. - instant infinite respawn on death. - infinite ammo (but still have to reload). - 2 teams (ct and t), aim is to complete an objective to win the round. which ever team is first to win 16 rounds wins the match. games can also end in a draw if both teams manage to get 15. - objectives, a round can be won by any of the following:  1. killing the whole enemy team (before the bomb is planted) 2. killing the whole enemy team (before a hostage is rescued) 3. defusing a planted bomb (ct win) 4. bomb explodes (t win) 5. by rescuing a hostage (ct win) - all players have a skill group ranging from unranked (lowest) to global elite (highest). players of a similar skill are placed together. - you cant leave the match, if you do you will get banned. - same as comp but any one can play with anyone else regardless of skill. - no ranking system - larger teams then comp. - leave or join match at any point - a collection of game modes based off of comp or deathmatch but with diffrent objectives (e.g. win round by getting kill with knife in arms race) and different conditions (e.g. low gravity in flying scout's man). - the war games are as follows: arms race, demolition, and flying scoutsman. - similar concept to PUBG or Fortnite. parachute in, large map, search around for weapons and loot.  to win, objective is to be last player alive. - servers are much smaller with only 16 players, which differs compared to the 100 players of other battle royale games like Fortnite. why would any hacker waste money on buying csgo when they can play it for free? remember that non prime (free to play) and prime (paid users) dont mix. so by making the game f2p: it separates legitimate users (people who are willing to pay money for the game), with hackers (people would rather save them selves a bit of money and play the free version, as there is no need for them to waste money getting prime). so yes there will be a lot more hackers in free version, but you won't have to deal with them if you yourself are prime. in my opinion this is one of the best moves valve could of made. and i understand there thinking as to why they did it."
Mendozacheers,True,"The ""third"" game in the critically acclaimed First Person Shooter series that have shaped the PC gaming industry for years. Originally a mod for Half-Life turned into a stand-alone, had a Soruce sequel, and now Global Offensive. Counter-Strike 1.6 has long been one of the most played steam titles, seeing as the entire Steam platform was created with Counter-Strike in mind. Today Global Offensive have actually surpassed the original game in player base, something that Counter-Strike: Source failed to achieve. I was never a hardcore Counter-Strike fan, I always had a buddy or two that were better than me. Therefore I can't tell you the perspective from a experienced CS player. A lot of players were disappointed in Counter-Strike: Source because it did change too much of the core mechanics. Others were disappointed that the game did not change enough. Global Offensive apparently somehwhat succeeded in both those things in some mysterious way. Some core 1.6 players like it, and the game is relatively friendly and easy for newcomers. Of course there are still players who disagre and still value 1.6 or even CSS better. Counter-Strike Global Offensive offers the same team based versus mode, where you spawn, buy items, and you are free to move around the map to find the enemy players. The maps are never too big, and you always spawn in the same area. The main objective is to kill all enemy opponents, but there's also the classic objective of planting the bomb, or saving the hostages - depending on the map. Once you die, you have to wait for the round to finish before you respawn. Classic maps such as de_dust and cs_office have found their ways into this title as well. Same goes for most of the classic weapons, AWP, M4A4, AK-47 etc. Beside the classic competetive team vs team, there's Arms Race and Demolition. Arms Race is a adoption of the classic ""Gun Game"" game mode from the original Counter-Strike, where the players are in a team deathmatch, and each kill will level up your weapon to the better. Demolition is a cross between Arms Race and classic ""plant the bomb""-objective just on smaller maps. There are also time-specific events such as Operation Payback and Bravo, where players must buy a pass to play on community made maps and to support the creators. Just like any other modern Valve title, this game comes with all the Steam features including Steam Workshop, where people can share their created weapon skins and maps. Just like Dota 2, the items does not change the gameplay in any way, only cosmetic stuff. There is also weapon drops in game that players can get, with different range of rarities - To bring the Team Fortress 2 lootfest to this game as well."

Reno,True,"Hey, i am just curious if anyone else does this. Every day when i take a shower, i like to turn the water super hot, hold my nuts in my hand and let the scalding hot water run over them. Lately my balls have been extremely itchy for some reason, so instead of itching them, i burn them with scalding hot water to relieve the itching and it is quite possibly the most amazing sensation i've ever felt in my life. It feels amazing and i'm doing less damage to the skin than if i were to scratch them. I just have to be careful because the hot water hitting my hand or my thighs hurts really bad so it can be difficult to only let the scalding hot water hit my nuts and nothing else. As i've been doing this, the itching has gotten less intense as the days go on so the treatment seems to be working. I know it's weird but i'm telling you it feels incredible. I'm not saying other people should try it, but if you've got an itch, perhaps a better alternative is to burn them with scalding hot water."

твойстарик Key-Drop.pl,True,"Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better. Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues. Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route. Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn’t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire.Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team. If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas – entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location – but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet Unlike other game types, Arms Race allows for respawns. It's the most chaotic and care-free mode in Global Offensive, with players throwing caution to the wind for the sake of climbing the kill ladder as quickly as possible. It's a shame there are only two maps in Arms Race -- a problem that will more likely persist on consoles than PC. If you have the option, playing the PC version is unquestionably the best way to experience Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Mods, mouse and keyboard, and the usual PC-only options are better than the ports. Plus, Valve is much better about long-term PC support -- it abandoned Team Fortress 2 on consoles, and Portal 2's level editor was PC exclusive"

TARS,True,"I played CS from 1.5 - started out when I was 12 or 13 I believe. Played 1.6 for years, went to live events and was by far my favorite game to play and watch. I remember the WCG in 2006 with Sweden vs Poland and how much I just loved the game. Eventually like everything, scene slowly died and between one thing and another stopped playing. In November of 2014 I wanted to give a shot at my favorite old FPS - which now was ""CS:GO"". Downloaded, tried it. At first I wasn't fully convinced due to the fact that I haven't played CS in ages and I was still used to 1.6, however - with some more time I started to like it. Watched Dreamhack final 2014, LDLC vs NiP and was glad to see familiar faces I knew from 1.6 like f0rest and get_right. I got hooked up once again and now it's for sure my favorite game yet again. There are some major things that need to be fixed like hitboxes, planting hitboxes, jumping hitboxes and ladder hitboxes. Valve needs to add 128 tick servers for match-making games and we need way more stats and in-depth graphs of our own performance on our profiles. Some weapon still needs some tweaking (AWP got nerfed too hard, hafl-way from now and older AWP would be perfect) and some pistols are still a bit too OP. All and all tho, even with these problems it's still a great game - however, if in the long run Valve doesn't take care of these major things and just keeps up the cosmetic side of CSGO I can see the community getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in the long run, but they're smart so hopefully it won't happen. Overall I give this game a 8/10 - that could be a 9/10 if they fixed the hitboxes/weapons and a  10/10 if we had 128 tick servers and more analysis. Cheaters are a HUGE problem of this game, so I also hope that Valve would seriously expand the VAC team. I stopped playing mm for this reason now mostly 10mans and faceit."

Dimitri Cosmos ✅,False,"CS:GO (and any CS for that matter) is an e-sports game. It is designed for competitive gaming. So, don't look for casual evening fun in it. It requires skill building and time investment. A lot of it. So, unless you are willing to make it a crucial portion of your life and have a clan or at least few friends to form a team, avoid the MP and play with bots. Although, elite bots are better than most of the newbs on the MP anyway. Alternatively, you can play with a positively careless mindset and ignore all the veterans, smurfs and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dominating the on-line community. You won't be on top of the leaderbords, but you'll get your moments, sweet kills and satisfying headshots. And from time to time the match making won't suck and you'll actually get to play with players who are on the same level you are. Apart from that, CS:GO has nice visuals, tons of maps and decent amount of game modes. The interface is nice, clean and simple, which is a pleasant change from the early CS 1.6 days. I liked the different skins of terrorists that matched the maps (e.g., bank robbers in bank and office maps, Africans in tropic maps, etc.) The voice acting is improved, as well. And the weapons have a pleasant feel and sound to them. What isn't nice however, is that the hitboxes are smaller than the body and the head. The weapons have spray patterns. And if that wasn't bad enough, those patterns are random. So, it's not entirely a matter of aiming, but luck, as well (unless you always get headshots from the first try). I'd rather prefer Insurgency with its one shot kills. Sometimes, those sprays patterns get so ridiculous that, even if you miss with your crosshair, you still hit the target, or bullets fly around corners or you miss from 2 m distance, while having the crosshair on the enemy's head. As to the bots, it's a mixed bag. They are challenging enough and mimic different behaviours of the human players, you'll come across in the MP, so you won't feel bored. However, on private matches, by default, they are programmed to raise their difficulty as soon as they reach the average human score. And it's not entirely balanced, because the elite bots have a pinpoint accuracy and insanely fast reaction speed. Also, they camp a lot, avoid bullets by side stepping and act as a team either by rushing agressively or camping at their spawn sites, from where they manage to snipe-kill across the map. These little things were frustrating for me and I'm sure I was not the only one. I wasn't expecting the bots to be better than human players. To make the autodifficulty more balanced you have to change the config. files, which is not a very convenient way to do it. Nevertheless, I admit that there's an addictive element to this game. And, overall I had fun playing either offline or with my friends.  It's hard to decide between ""Yes"" or ""No""; however, with all things considered, I can't recommend it, because, after all, this game has cheap psychology behind it. CS:GO is like crack of the gaming world. It promises you brief moments of glory, passing satisfaction for dominance over other players and sense of illusory achievement and it delivers that promise from time to time, however that comes at the cost of procrastination, rage, anger and frustration. There are more subtle and ellaborate games on the market to kill your time with. And there's certainly more things in life to accomplish and feel proud of than some stupid ranks and K:D ratio. My overall rating: 6/10."

Ｚａｒｂｏｎ 神,True,"I've had the beta since March and it's getting better and better for each update. Will be one of the most popular games, no doubt. :)"
T R :o Y,True,"I must recommend this game, it is my duty as one who has spent 1600 hours on CSS (from xFire) and 500+ hours on CSGO. I played non-stop competitive CS:Source in regional championships, LANs, and online leagues; and won 4 regional championships with some LAN placings. Here's what I have to say about GO... CSGO is awesome, Valve delivered here in the end. When it was released, yeah, it wasn't anything special, just a pretty CS:Source. But now we have amazing gun skins, stickers, awesome knives, intense major tournaments, souvenir packages, bracket prediction challenges, seasonal operations with extra maps and challenges for even more drops, etc. It's awesome, it's a great game to be a part of. Matchmaking and rated matchmaking based personal ELO rankings is a sweet way to keep competitive games close. It can never be perfect, but back in Source you had to wait in an IRC channel with a looped message playing until someone finally answered your loop and then it took them 20 minutes to get 5 in the server, etc. Basically with CS:Source whether you were trying to ring or you had your team it took between 20-60 minutes to get a scrim. Now it takes about 5. So, the fact that people still complain about it is beyond me. Game play wise, each CS as I know them (1.6, Source, GO) has been different beasts in terms of mechanics and recoil control. Lots of little things that made or broke you as a player in these games, but recoil control is one of the biggest. You often hear people scream “deathmatch deathmatch deathmatch, that's the only way to get better”. Well, quick point, how can you DM to practice when you don't know what your practicing? Best thing to do to understand the recoil patterns is load an offline game, kick the bots, and shoot at walls. Seriously. Shoot and spray at walls with various guns at various ranges with various movement patterns, that's the best way to understand how to control and use various guns. You need to understand each guns grouping patterns first before you can practice controlling them! About the community, yes, the flamers and trolls are alive and well. But here's the thing, I've been around CS a long time, I've won 4 regional championships with CS:Source, and really it never bothered me that sometimes the flamers are all you hear. Here's why. Once you play enough games (competitive or otherwise) you'll hear the same kind of person, it'll sound like this.. “you guys suck, why are you even playing this game?” or something similar if they are beating you. It sounds like this, “you're such a hacker, it's so obvious” when you beat them. The fact that people are so binary in their mentality amuses me personally, so I carry that over to CS flamers as well. Some people like to pretend they are perfect at the game, and everyone else around them is inferior, yet if you beat them you must be a hacker. It just sounds so stupid to even talk about it but seriously this is how a lot of people are about the game. Just don't let it get to you, there's no point. Don't even engage. And you wont have many problems. It's not the easiest game to pick up right off the bat. “Spray at feet, get headshot” is a notorious saying from outsiders about CS games, because CS can be amazingly random sometimes. And the round-by-round economy, buying guns and items every round, and recoil patterns make it a steep learning curve. But if you understand the groupings (I said how to above), read guides about strategy (like economy management, game flow), and just get in there and start playing you will see why people just can't stop playing this game! Counter-Strike was the world's original eSport. After the Championship Gaming Series went down the CS1.6 and CS:Source attention did as well, games like StarCraft and DOTA took to the forefront of competitive eSports soon after. But with the cases, skins, and major tournaments Valve and the CS community have turned CS:GO back into one of the world's premiere eSports and there's many, many reasons why it's succeeding. As I say, it's a very exciting game to be a part of right now."

Now the whole community can see that it's not about the game itself, but it's just about how much money you're pulling out of a deadly game with cheaters. I personally do not recommend this game just from your desire to pull out all your money and at the same time your entire bank account (if this sentensive didnt make sense it is from Google Translate sorry about that) So thats all what i wanted to say.

FIre Goose,False,"I can describe CsGo and the CsGo community in one word...Aids. Counterstrike is a fun fast strategic shooter that has been around for years. But slowly as the cod and console community moves over to pc they bring there negative and ♥♥♥♥♥y attitudes. I myself is an offender of this. But I have time on my hand to write this review because i was just in a competative match and got a 24 hour ban... We were kicking the other teams♥♥♥♥♥and the good o'l sqeuakers that were on my team decided to throw the game away at 6-12 us, so for the next 9 rounds my team took an♥♥♥♥♥pounding. This would've been my rank up game and i would be one step closer to be the best, that no one ever was. ""but wait...Two Girls One Awp...you can still rank up if you loose."" Well thats the funny thing. These little quickscoping killstreak wanting peices of♥♥♥♥♥♥wanted to prolong my climb to the top and thought it would be funny to ♥♥♥♥ing kick me. So now im sitting here writing this ♥♥♥♥ing review that no one but my friends will ♥♥♥♥ing see. But, I digress if you like learning to play a game dont buy this game because i swear to you the moment you get in the game some we call you a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥cunt who is legit ♥♥♥♥ing trash and should kill yourself while butt ♥♥♥♥ing your dad...that is what you experience. If you somehow can get good at this game then maybe you will find a nice group of lads that can work well with you.

This game will ruin friendships turn you into a monster. will i still play? ya but not in the next 24 ♥♥♥♥ing hours because the ban system is the most broken thing on the ♥♥♥♥ing planet.  But now you know what the core gameplay is like lets talk about the skins. Oh the skins. Beautiful skins. Marble fade karambit, dragon lore, vulcan, and all the cool knifes. wait. $1000 DOLLARS. are you ♥♥♥♥ing kidding me i could buy a new graphics card and a prossecer♥♥♥♥♥♥a new ♥♥♥♥ing car. Yes every good looking skin in this game is made for two types of people youtubers that are so rich they can start a bank and the little kid that steals his mommys purse. Oh and dont even think about trading your skins outside of steam because everyone and their mothers is a scammer. And i have one more thing to say about this game. about 30% of the community is female and thats a lot because 6 million plus people play cs go on a regular bases. But how much of that 30% are not egirls looking to use there body to use you about 10% most girls you will meet on cs go are the ♥♥♥♥♥iest chicks on the planet who join the game and are like ""hey guys Im a guuurl""♥♥♥♥♥♥they may asswell come in and say, ""Give me skins because i have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ you will never see""                So to some it up better invest in a therepist after this game becasue you will need one                                                                     10 outa 10"

xamon,False,"Too many things are wrong in this game,movement is not smooth, awp quickscope and deagle are innacurate and not fun to play anymore, p90 and running is♥♥♥♥♥♥ flashes are not efective,  nades are not accurate, limited wallbanging and stupid ammo limitation on M4/USP, burst fire on FAMAS is useless, maps cluttered with unexpected props and corners to slow you down and block nades, certain areas are not wide enough and causes acidental TK on rushes and inability to rush fast as an whole favors CT play, and the most important, recoil does not allow you to kill multiple enemies in 1 magazine in a short period of time, you are limited to short bursts and take cover, and that removes the ability to clutch rounds which was the most fun aspect in other versions. It prevents good skilled aimers from carrying a team.  Skill ceiling is way lower than it was in CS 1.6 and shot hitreg is mostly random, even if you aim perfectly at the head, there is always a luck factor and you can always miss the shot, unless at extremely close ranges. Skill is not so important and instead favors using tons of smokes and nades to deplete time for Terrorists, and T´s cannot do much about it since nades and flashes are so weak in this version. Also most maps are really bad unbalanced copies of CSS maps, like inferno and train, and people are forced to pay for operation passes to play extra maps in matchmaking. On the other hand there are many improvements in money and weapon balance specially on ecos, (altough pistols/shotguns are still overpowered and other misc stuff like the GUI, matchmaking and de_nuke balanced, and I would rather play GO with this problems fixed than going back to 1.6 anyday, but at this moment the game is not fun anymore and gameplay is not fully oriented for competitive gameplay. I only play it because nobody plays the other versions anymore, and most people have to eat it up. This game had very low player count before the steam market update since the game was really bad, but after it many people started playing it to earn skins, so most of the players dont care about the game, they just idle for drops and watch streams to know on wich teams to bet on csgolounge, they dont actually care about the game, it is a sad truth and its clear that Hidden Path will never update this game to proper conditions."

Cabron,True,"What remains to say to the game still a lot was said .... I write now my own comment and no Russian speaking I still cannot. Would you like to get to know or meet Russians? You like it to play a multiplayer 5 vs. 5 virtually to play alone. You'll love it in a communication/ teamplay- game to speak to oneself,  because no one else does. It's fun when everyone does what he wants,  all run in different directions without meaning and purpose. You're also of the opinion that expensive pro-gamer headsets are unnecessary. Who needs headphones or what to make announcements. You're tired of being scolded by the French in Call of Duty. You like to put more money in a game than necessary. You like it when you buy expensive weapons skins which are later less worth. You love to play a game for all eternity, But still not reach a new level as in other games. You like to be scolded as a noob because you have 2 kills less than the one who insults you. If you play a different weapon than all the others you are badly made. Your love for Eastern countries increases thereby you will harder. If you play alone then you meet strangers who can not speak your language or English. You are kicked out of the game when your team players do not like you. Your teammates are not always better than you, with the time you start Votekick like a Russian. Unnecessary games where you do not meet trollers / hackers does not interest you. So do not waste time with FaceIT and other things .. You do not like beginner-friendly games because you are the PRO-Gamer. The game is aimed at competition with teamplay, announcements and hearing That is why it is so popular because it requires players, but not the pc. Since I play the game, I always look exactly who is adding me. In doubt, take no one suspect in your friendlist most want partial only your skins. ""I am Dimitri I send to you friendship request you accept! And now lie down quietly on the floor, click on LINK and give me your CS: GO Skins. Many thanks for your cooperation "" You do not like long instructions and do not know what to do now. Then it's time to dive into the nicest gaming community there is. Did I say you can buy it?  I said you have to buy it! CS: GO is like a greedy woman, but you love her forever until the end of time. The feeling of hate and love connects and you can not change anything. It's like roulette quite fun unless you play the Russian. Was bleibt zu dem Spiel noch zu sagen viel wurde gesagt .... Ich schreib mal meinen eigenen Kommentar und nein Russisch kann ich noch immer nicht. Sie möchten gerne Russen kennenlernen? Es gefällt ihnen ein Multiplayer 5 gegen 5 praktisch alleine zu spielen. Sie lieben es in einem auf Kommunikation  Teamplay Basierenden Spiel  mit sich selbst zu reden, weil es sonst niemand tut. Es macht ihnen Spaß wenn jeder nur das tut was er will,  alle in verschiedene Richtungen laufen ohne Sinn und Zweck. Sie sind auch der Meinung das teuere Pro-Gamer Headsets unnötig sind. Wer braucht denn schon überhaupt Kopfhörer oder wozu Ansagen machen. Sie sind es leid in Call of Duty bloß von Franzosen beschimpft zu werden.. Es gefällt ihnen mehr Geld in ein Spiel zu stecken als notwendig wäre. Es gefällt ihnen wenn sie teure Waffenskins kaufen der später weniger wert ist. Sie lieben es ein Spiel bis in alle Ewigkeit zu spielen,  aber trotzdem kein neues Level zu erreichen wie in anderen Games. Sie stehen drauf als Noob beschimpft zu werden weil sie 2 Kills weniger haben als er. Wenn  sie eine anderen Waffe spielen als alle anderen werden sie schlechtgemacht Ihr Liebe zu  Östlichen Länder steigt dadurch werden sie härter. Alleine spielt man mit Fremden die deine Sprache nicht können. Sie werden aus dem Spiel gekickt wenn ihre Teammitspieler sie nicht mögen. Ihre Teammates sind nicht immer besser als sie, mit der Zeit startet man auch Votekick wie ein Russe. Unnötige Spiele wo man auf Anständige nicht Troller/Hacker trifft interessiert sie nicht. Deshalb keine Zeit mit FaceIT und anderen Dingen verschwenden…. Sie mögen keine Anfängerfreundliche Spiele den sie sind der PRO-Gamer. Das Game ist auf Wettkampf ausgerichtet mit Teamplay, Ansagen und Gehör. Genau darum ist es so beliebt weil es Spieler fordert, den PC aber nicht. Seit ich spiele schaue ich auch immer genau wer mich addet. Im Zweifelsfalle niemand Suspekten annehmen, die wollen teilweise nur deine Skins. „Ich bins Dimitri ich dir schicken Freundschaftsanfrage du annehmen!  Und jetzt ganz ruhig auf den Boden, klick auf LINK und geben mir deine CS:GO Skins...  Viele Dank für Mitarbeit“ Sie mögen keine lange Anleitungen und wissen nicht was Sie nun machen sollen. Dann wird es Zeit in die nettesten Gaming-Community einzutauchen die es gibt. Hab ich gesagt du kannst es kaufen, ich sagte du musst es kaufen!!!!!!!!!!!!!! CS:GO ist wie eine gierige Frau, aber sie lieben sie für IMMER! Das Gefühl von Hass und Liebe vereint sich sie können nichts mehr daran ändere. Es ist wie Roulette ziemlich spaßig außer man spielt das Russische."

ONra1G,True,"If you're reading this review, be sure to read all of it due I placed an update, but I did not want to change the original review.  this game is 7/10 Positive:  [✓] Huge community (veteran players, kids, noobs, masters)  [✓] amazing eSport scene  [✓] Example of a team work game   Negative  [✓] worst system anti cheater, they can do it better, but they will not do it because valve love sell more copies to the cheaters  [✓]64 tick. WTF valve!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WE NEED MORE!  [✓] CHEATER EVERYWHERE!!!!!!!!, IN DM, CASUALS, MM, DEMOLITION AND GUNGAME CHEATER EVERYWHERE!!!!!!!!!!! this game is 7/10 EDIT: update (3 of july 2015) I have been following the complete scene of this game and im back here to change something about my original review (that I have not modified and you can read it above). Valve is listening to the community and they have been doing constant VAC ban waves. Also they put some new system to prevent the immediately access in MatchMaking to the cheaters and smurfers (in this part i dont mind but for a lot of people is a issue, they are listening)  Now i can say 8/10. Great game. EDIT: feb/11/2016 some wrong spelled words. EDIT: 23/NOV/2016 this game has evolved a lot: EDIT: 25/NOV/2017 Can we get better customization for the cl_crosshairstyle 1 ?!??!?!"
Mally,True,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive truly is a game like no other. In Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, you are tasked with globally offending as many people as you possibly can in 30 rounds, with an array of tools such as mic spam, teamkilling, or racist bullet messages. It differs from the original Counter-Strike (Known as '1.6' because there are 1.6 people still playing) in the fact that it's not 37 years old. Counter-Strike Hardline refines the tried and true formula of Police (Voiced by Nolan North) vs Counter-Police (Voiced by Troy Baker), bringing in many new faces to each team, such as Jewish Toad from Super Mario Bros, a black guy, a ghost with a beret, and a hot topic customer. Counter-Strike: Black Ops adds exactly 3 new zones for you to wreak havoc in, bringing the total amount of maps to 1, but makes up for it with a large arsenal of over 70 weapons, which I will now list for you. -Ak-47 -M4 -AWP All in all, Counter-Strike: Global Defensive is a robust top down open world third person beat 'em up that tweaks the gunplay to its best, with amazing graphics and sound design, it's bound to keep you hooked until Counter-Strike 5. 0/5"

cloudness,True,"Counter Strike - a huge franchise from Valve, I mean who hasn't heard of the countless streams, case openings and wizardrys all around this game, right?  As someone who has played previous Counter Strikes, I get mixed feelings when thinking about Global Offensive. No, not the russians cussing in their casual environment on dust2 cause this, but rather all the hype about the rather questionable content of the actual game. For me, I always tend to find myself having difficulties in games that offer people to spend real-life money for a game, especially if it's for skins that do only aesthetically change your game, but let's talk about that anyways. For those which do not know about it (likely not many people), CSGO offers people to gain Skins for your weapons, by either getting them dropped while playing, or opening cases (that cost) that contain many different skins, with a randomized chance of getting something good or bad.  Considering this game has made it to ESL-Niveau, where even Teams, Tournaments, Global Matches and Prizes exist, having a pay-to-win aspect in it, is quite necessary nowadays. I do not mean to critisize anyone liking this, as I myself have had an inventory worth more than 10'000$ (by gambling), I definetely do understand the kick for all of this, but after all, as an old school gamer I'm asking you; Is this what gaming has envolved into? People getting CRAZY about chargeable SKINS that only aesthetically make a difference? You tell me. Anyways, enough of that crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥ opinions are opinions, right? Controls are okay, graphics don't matter anyways, teamplay is strong, skill is required, what else to say? I think there are enough reviews about the actual game mechanics other than the critizised points listed above, so let me be your hero and skip that part.  I haven't written reviews in a while, so let's end this one as it would fit into the CSGO Community. C yka ♥♥♥♥♥, I'll smoke mid, gg wp."

Sheridan,False,"Valve could've made this a good game, but they simply fold under the pressure of the community too much these days. The original Counter-Strikes (including Source) were all good fun to be had, pretty well designed and balanced, but GO went the wrong direction. First off,   (and to be frank the only thing this review will discuss so as to simply give you a general idea of my point)  - this is a big gameplay mechanic which as far as I know was hardly if ever present in the originals (was much harder to do or just impossible) and just lemme preface this review with saying that I'm not allergic to changes, I'm allergic to bad game design. This mechanic is quite powerful as knowing exactly where your bullets will end up can let you fire full auto with laser rifle accuracy, and this opens up the possibility of a huge skill gap out of nowhere. They wanted to allow players the ability to play Counter-Strike LESS competitively, and this feature which was pretty much totally absent in the past but in normal play this has become a staple.   I've heard before of the internet mocking the phenomenon of casual gaming and I can assure you, I don't like my games to be too easy. The beauty of a fun game is a balance of struggle and fun. It's just that Counter-Strike demands too much of the former and gives way to only a tiny smear of the latter."
uhhh blazblad,True,this game is really bad
Dan | Greuceanu,True,"The best Counter-Strike iteration yet. A lot of updates, steam workshop, competitive mode, competitions, skins and constant content. A good way to make steam wallet money by trading or selling stuff in market. None of the games you will play will have the fluidity of a valve game and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive sets the standard. 10/10"
The_MadGeniuz,True,"This game has become a great FPS in my library. I played a CS mod many, many years ago (Tactical Ops: Assualt on Terror) and loved it always wanted to play it online but never could at that time. I finally bought Global Offensive and I've been impressed everything I was expecting and much more. It's a simple FPS with different modes search and destroy, hostange rescue, TDM, and more. I will give you the warning, it's very difacult to be good at this game. The level of compitition is great. I honestly can go into a game and suck and have fun or light up the scores and still have fun. I typically play just competitive matches where it's a 30 round game first team to 16 round wins wins the match. It varies by map as to which game mode you play and in each round you only get one life. Sounds hard right? Exactly! Competitive is a blast. I highly recomend this game if you like FPS and like playing online. Use stradegy, play with friends, play with strangers and remember DO NOT PLAY THIS WITHOUT HEADPHONES IF IN PUBLIC PLACE! ""The bomb has been planted is not something you want heard outloud. Just saying. My rating 9.5/10 very awesome game!"

If you are looking for a better MM experience then FACEIT or ESEA are your best bet. Giving Prime to every user who bought the game was a total joke.

No, alot of closet hackers play with esp & no-spread only and usually cannot be confirmed %100. Either ones you come across it doesn't matter because ""$3 accounts, bro."" ^this whole thing could be cleaned up/worded better. ijdgaf (EDIT) 12/28 - Couple months ago I made it into overwatch beta. During the downtime, when this game wasn't in the limelight (Oct) for a while, the case reviews against players actually cheating was about 1 in 7. Meaning , a full 60 minutes of watching 6 players who have been reported for playing well with no indication of cheating. Followed by 10 minutes of 1 player darting his reticle to enemy players through the walls throughout the game or the occasional asshat(s) body blocking an awping team mate, blocking a teammate into a corner, teamkilling/damaging a teammate to low health. When the holiday auction hiccup happened and people got free cs:go copies, that ratio went from 1:7 to 1:1. Every other case was like a throwaway account not even attempting to hide it, staring at the ground, spinning like crazy, bhopping throughout nuke, dust2, and mirage headshotting every player they came across.  ""Hey look at me Get♥♥♥♥♥♥on baddie $0 accounts bro."" As of late december It's 1 in 3. It's safe to say, when anything involves a flux of accounts via price or giveaway in cs:go there will be a relative flux of cheating players."

DirtyNastyDave,True,The game of a generation. Travel the globe and gather the most wonderful objects created by man. Put them in a magic bag with a pile of moondust. The contents of said bag would still suck in comparison to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. 10/10
AirFlow,True,"Since the dawn of time, I have lost hope in fps games and life itself generally because of milked franchises. The sky had no color, food had no flavor. After playing this truly amazing life-altering of a game, I can honestly say I'm a changed man.  CS GO has captured my imagination and took me into my unknown sub-conscious.  This game has made a profound impact to me. Never before I felt like ripping another human beings head off. Uninstalling, reinstalling became a daily routine for the millionth time because of clueless teammates and their ""cool skins"" (I guess skin > skill matters more). I feel like everyone needs to play this game at least acouple of times because the thrill of clutching, fragging, etc is unlike anything I've experienced. It takes me back to the good old CoD4/ Gears of War/ Battlefield days, having clan battles either GB or underground rules blah blah blah. A true fps that is fun for all ages! For the casual players, you can just have fun with mods and for the competitive, you will def enjoy this. From the ""your mom"" 12yr old squeakers to the maturest people. This community is toxic as you'd expect, but from the smurf and hackers, you'll either quit or keep on trying."
ZeroИervE >),True,"The 2 year and 2000hr summary;  Pro – One of the most popular games on the steam network Con – One of the most popular games on the steam network Pro – Immersive, complex and highly teamwork dependent game.  Con – The lobby system, the matchmaking system and general practice of  “alternate accounts” really tends to crap all over the above mentioned pros.  Pro – Allot of cool stuff available to buy, trade, sell! The trading and marketplace really brings a whole new perspective to gaming while teaching us valuable real world lessons. Con – With that being said, its almost impossible to not spend more money then the initial price. Getting tricked by scumbag traders, account hacked and your awesome stuff stolen are only the tip of cringe stories. Oh did I mention they are just skins with no function? :D Conclusion: *smacks forehead* Look... The game is JUST OKAY. IT IS NOT the ultimate online pc shooter, but learning to play CAN BE TONS OF FUN with your friends. Hmm, whats this? Catch a little confidence? No worries!! Keep playing and the awesome CSGO community will be right there to rip it all to shreds and shove it back in your face. Cheers! That's all.. You may catch a few laughs outta the sh*** I wrote in the past down below, but with this summary my review is now complete.  Peace out.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ WOW... Just wow... Smurfs, Jerks and hackers! DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME COMPETETIVE IF YOU WANT TO HAVE FUN !!! (Unless, fun to you is getting aggravated, being yelled at for not playing good and not knowing everything about the game.) If you wish to gain a good rank, join a team who will help you get carried or boost you for money. As for ranking up as an individual the only way to do that, is to have friends who have the proper skills for a highly competitive gameplay and all you have to do is plant or defuse the bomb while they cover for you... You then learned nothing. :/ That makes it a TEAM GAME I guess. That way you can gain team points PER ROUNDS WIN and that is all !!! Kill / death ratio doesn't matter anymore, you are as GOOD or as CRAP as your team is. Level up with your friends or they will soon not play with you and you get stuck in what is referred to as ""silver hell."" Good luck getting out of that because, it means allot of headaches as these teams will consist of players who legit ""don't know what they are doing"" against players who purchased a secondary account and posses the seemingly PRO SKILLS you DO NOT when you're wanting to learn and get better at competitive gameplay. You'll just end up getting killed by them, your team will yell at you and you will suffer though a horrible loss, because you cannot abandon a match without receiving a ""cooldown time"" an you will learn NOTHING!!! These highly skilled players with secondary low rank accounts are so called ""smurfs."" They are a form of cyberbullies who like stroke their own d***ks while they play against inexperienced players who are trying to figure out how to play better. All the while smurfs are calling you names, aggravating you and causing team moral to drop. Soon your whole team is yelling at you and practically forcing you to quit and once again you learned nothing... Do yourself a favor and don't pay for mental anguish! GLHF! (Good luck, have fun. Which this game is neither!) -----Update 1------ Yes, a bit of clearing up is need even if this review is long enough as is.  One part I agree with Pete, the casual and deathmatch modes are flooded, where the competitive side is strictly teams of 5 v 5.  As in how to deal with smurfs and hackers is not that straightforward. No one plays comp to purposely loose. (Unless you're trolling or want to derank your account.. but why!?)  Face it, loosing sucks but specially when item drops have also been reduced to nothing and when they do they are items that are in extremely bad condition and worth only a few cents. Then the only way to battle the smurfs is to have friends who are willing to teach you the game. That way when you pull together as a team, utilize your grenades well, pay attention to positioning and aim, you will have a fighting chance because usually the smurf is the last one or two player(s) alive. Only then it could be made into a monster! :D Good luck and (try to) have fun! ----Update 2----- Thanks for all the responses everyone! The rank and matchmaking system is for the lack of a better word, is bonkers! :D I actually enjoy helping new players with tips and hints on getting better. It's just something I've gotten to a great liking of eversince leading the CS:S division of a multigaming clan back in those days. One other thing recently occurred to me while playing CS:GO, is that hours played and kill / death ratio should also come into factor. For instance, when I started out in CS:GO I was invited to comp matches by friends who are in the range of Nova-2 to Master Guardian ranks. I've quickly received my Silver Master Elite rank, which I went onto advance into the mid Nova range. Solo queing and just general messing around (once the game was an inevitable loss) I have managed to derank my account to the mid silver range.  I keep performing in the mid range of the score board also, but its by choice because I've came to accept the fact that its going to take me a reeaallyy long time to gain my nova ranks back. When I'm asked to pull it together its not hard for me to get kills, give good strats and sometimes even start to carry my team. I just cant help but be frustrated when I do constantly perform good and is top mvp and every 10 game or more still not budge a rank. GLHF, but most importantly HAVE FUN because that's up to each and every one of us to enjoy the game even if its a bit broken!"
Svirt,True,"It's modern version of cs 1.6 and I think its more realistic with new design of skins, walls and everything. Its really good game to play with friends. Ranking and competitive game systems are most valuable things in Global offensive. There are achievements for achieve-hunters, arms race (typical gun-game) or demolition mode - so game has everything I wanted. CS:GO settings is changing all the time, but it will only anger you, so dont care about it just play! :D Still the best multiplayer FPS. 8.5 /10 Must love that gun."
Ivan,True,"This is quite an enjoyable game. Driving through detailed environment is beautiful. As you progress through the game, you build up your truckers to work for your company, etc. It's a pretty deep experience."

AxelhacK,False,"Old: I am an ♥♥♥♥♥♥. CS 1.6 and CS:S were better! ________________________________________________________________ New: Okay, after people asking me: ""Hey Axel, why does cs go suck?"", I gotta explain it. My dear friend, prepare for a long review, full of bad english and hate and♥♥♥♥♥♥and stuff and... yea, you got it. Let's start with the most annoying thing, Dear Volvo! Explain me, how to ruin source engine that hard? Corrupting bunny hopping, surfing, sliding (if someone actually remembers this game mod), football, minigames, jail (i dislike jail, but feel free to get angry if you liked it) and worst of all, trikz and kreedz. Why don't you Volvo release 2 versions of CS:GO? One for fun mods, one for competitive (which is♥♥♥♥♥♥ but i'll come later to it) and feel free to even sell it as 2 different games. I would still buy both and be happy. why the hell don't weapons have 100% precision now while standing still and doing nothing? Why does every 4th-5th shot with AK miss? Let's make every skill game to a luck game? Like minesweeper, ""skill"" - ""skill"" - ""skill"" - ""now i need to guess"". Yes, here you'll see all the complaints about tickrate, hitreg and interpolation. What is interpolation? As a player, you receive and send packets from/to server to ""communicate"" with the game. These packets contain the information you see later. Your ping is the ""speed"" of how fast you receive the packets. But no one's connection is perfect, so if we only used these packets, the game would lag and be unplayable. So there is an old trick, interpolation: You receive a packet, then you receive a second packet and the actual gameplay you see on screen is in between. This means, what you see, happens in the past and the server is a few milliseconds in the future. This is how you get shot with an awp ""while the guy was running just before he shot me OMGOMGOMG TRIQQER HAX"". In reality, the server has already calculated that he stopped and this is why his precision was nearly 100%. Let's calculate the nice and fun interpolation in MadMaking: cl_interp_ratio / cl_updaterate = cl_interp 1 sec / 64 updaterate = 15,625 ms every new packet. cl_interp_ratio 2 = 2/64 = 31,25 ms for 2 packets to you receive/send so the server reacts. It may happen that a few packets get lost and hits won't be registered on server but you will see these on your screen. Now we have lag compensation. Command Execution Time = Current Server Time - Packet Latency - Client View Interpolation This means there are small mistakes regarding where the player is and where you saw him and you have to live with it. Volvo could reduce it to minimum by doubling the server tickrate, BUT higher tickrate means higher CPU load, means higher costs and poor Volvo earns only   and can't spend more money to get better servers. You can read more about interpolation  . And more about lag compensation  . Yes, I totally forgot to mention that in my review, first time i was writing it. Microtransactions are just another way to make more money by offering unnecessary content. We've already seen enough in TF2. Volvo thought, let's recreate the same marketing strategy again. And skins came out. Of course, what else could you do? Creating new paid weapons? Community would tear you in pieces, dear GabeN, because CS:GO is meant to be competitive and there is nothing competitive in pay2win. But money is not everything! There are even more reasons to add skins. There are people out there who love trading and collecting this♥♥♥♥♥♥(not to mention people who just buy em for e♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Then there are operations. If not to mention that maps are often unfinished, some are buggy, the idea is not that bad. You pay for the coin and that coin gives you stats. But again, there are missions to do and completing a mission gives you a drop - really? The marketing strategy strikes back, even more when you get a case drop as a ""reward"". Even DLCs are not that bad compared to skins. Why not making unfinished map DLCs like EA or Activision already do? Microtransactions suck. First of all, thank you for adding a new game mod called ""Demolition"". It's quite fun when you want to waste your time on fast paced maps. Thank you for adding ""Deathmatch"" as a game mod, to play on official servers. But how did you ruin the gun game? ""Arms Race"" now puts better players in disadvantage by highlighting them red. Of course it's better for new players to find these. It's maybe fun untill you get matched versus non silvers who start wallbanging you. But to the hell with casuals, we have competitive nowdays built in CS:GO. First of all, I am global myself and have played CS for 15 years now. And I can tell, I expected more. Global, yes, global must be global. You do get matched with people, I can't say they deserved global. I barely see the difference between eagle and global. Yes, these people are slightly better, but still only people. I expected to play vs people from high tier and not someone who ends his game with 3/5/25. Yes, some people have bad days, are sick, whatever. But this happens way too often. Competitive bans are a joke. I trolled 100 games and got reported 9999 times. Where is my ban for griefing? I never got one. Of course there are alternatives as ESL (which is dead in cs go, soon just dead) or ESEA. What do we have matchmaking for, then? Also, it happened quite often that when Steam servers went down, I finished MM and couldn't start a new one, because ""still in game"". And you abandon it and get your 10 mins ban. Smurfs, I have no problem with these since I got 6 smurfs myself. Anyways, all the new protection systems are useless, since if I want to play with friends, I do so. Cheaters, the only thing I am positive about Volvo are VAC waves. Honestly, I think this is where CS:GO made a positive progress. Of course there are cheaters out there, there will always be. But VAC bans are perma. I could wish for was that CS:GO would cost like 100€, so it'd be actually painful to buy it again and again for cheating. You ruined CS:S once in 2010. You still do ruin CS:GO. With horrible skins, with people who play competitive for fun (actually you people, ♥♥♥♥ off this game and play competitive for fun in Call of Duty), with engine ""tweaks"" and everything I called above + sending most people to the ""new"" CS. Oh, one more point. This game is ♥♥♥♥ing easy. It's easy as hell, there is no easier version of CS out there and there will hopefully never be. It is made this way so Volvo can sell it to 6 year olds and profit for it. Because getting pwnd is not fun, but the easiness factor is just made by money. - This is why bhop is dead! - This is why trikz/bugs are dead! - This is why they don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about the engine! - This is why competitive went full casual! - This is why you play this game! You, dear review reader, are the reason why good games die. Because you want to win and master a game in 10 hours. You don't want to ♥♥♥♥ around and master every engine exploit. You better go cry into a corner about ""that one guy was bhoping"", ""the deagle is too op"", ""this game has too many cheaters"" and ""the ban system is unfair, I got banned for 7 days, because my internet died ONCE"". Do your thing guys and ruin vidyas. Peace! TL;DR: Perfect game for all CoD fans. Only problem is you can't zoom with AK, but you'll get used to it, I promise."

ॐ HIT⊥∃D ॐ ︻デ═---,False,"As I am not a friend from quickly looking at a game then glorify or damn it, I decided to write a review after playing more than 1000 hours.  If you like skilled games and train hard to become better, this game is one you stick along time with it. After hundreds of hours, you still find ways to play it, places to hide, tactics to use etc. So this game greatly combines skill with tactics and teamplay and from this  I would highly recommend it. I also like the point, that you can obtain skins for your favorite weapons but to pay more for coloured pixels than for a real gun or knife is pervy.  BUT the longer I play this game there are things that really suck with this game. A bunch of friends starting with me to play this game do not any more cause of some very bad issues.  With more hours and over 280 competitives won, one should think to have become a better player than with 100 or 200 hours of gameplay. But fact is since the change of ELO system, which since seem to adapt to a balance of the ranks I (and a lot of my friends) did not manage to get a better rank than GNM, thus beeing MG2 before. This means in my case I am still an average player, who did not gain any progression in game skill. This I would have to accept.  BUT if I do competitive MM in a full team, where no one is smurfing we have the chance of 50/50 to play against enemies who do have one or more players, which are far better than the best player in my team. So often they confess to be smurfs (People playing with a second account on a level much lower, than their main accounts), or they might be hacking or they are high level players boosting up new accounts for selling them later. So this is the reason that average players have no change going to higher levels. Valve might have recognized this issue since they intend a premium membership of accounts which are confirmed by smartphone (so it would be expensive für smurfs or boosters to have a lot of different smartphone SIM cards).  In Casual Gaming people advertize that they use hacks, advertize for hacking websites e.g. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ . n e t,  e z f r a g s . c o . u k etc. I did report them and looked into their steam profiles weeks after that but they never get VAC banned after weeks. Steam and VAC does not seem to much effort in VAC banning these people and getting these websites removed.  There is also one thing that could be improved: Steam should provide servers with a tickrate of 128 for competitive MM. Steam is earning a lot of money from people ""paying to shine"" for weapon skins or knifes, so money should not be the issue.  I still will play this game for some time, but considering the game fun and nearly lack of progression for average players I do not recommend this games to start with it."
Yuyu,False,"This is a Counter-Strike game, you know what to expect.. You shoot bullets out of various guns and plant/defuse bombs. What you might not expect is the alarmingly high volume of cheaters and how they largely go unchecked by Valve; not to mention that Valve seem to leave this game on the very far backburner in terms of company priorities."
